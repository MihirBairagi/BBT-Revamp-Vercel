  "postcontent": "<p>The World is not enough, clearly not in the fast lanes. If impressive quarter miles and top speeds weren&rsquo;t enough, manufacturers are now making the ride placid with top-tier luxury demeanor. The new age four-door Sports Coupe not only can drive at a football field per second speed but also can do so with the luxury of sedan like space and comfort for a small family with 2 kids.</p>\n\n<p>Though Mercedes-Benz introduced mid-sized luxury coupe CLS in 2004, it wasn&rsquo;t until Porsche came out with Panamera in 2009, that the race in this segment really caught up. Soon after in 2010 British luxury marquee Aston Martin introduced its four-door, high performance sport saloon called the Aston Martin Rapide.</p>\n\n<p>Based primarily on the Aston Martin DB9, the Rapide was built at the Magna Steyr facility in Graz, Austria till 2012. The assembly was then shifted to Gaydon in England, which made it all the more British.</p>\n\n<p>With the wonderfully handcrafted, front mounted 6.0L, V12 engine, this beauty could do 0-100kmph in about 5.3sec. The 477 PS of peak power with a torque 600 Nm is delivered to the rear wheel through a Carbon Fiber Drive Shaft from a rear mid-mounted 6 speed Touchtronic gearbox.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, the engine received minor upgrades and showed an increase of 111 PS. While the CO2 emissions went down to 332g/km, the top speed saw a nominal increase of 3kmph from the previous model. The acceleration too, increased and the 0-100kmph now stood at 4.9sec, quicker by 0.4sec.</p>\n\n<p>In 2014, the car received some more cosmetic and performance upgrades and the New Aston Martin Rapide S now comes with an 8 Speed Transmission, a very slight increase in the max. Power to 560 PS and another 0.5 sec quicker than the previous model. Magnificently this beauty now touches the triple digits speed in just 4.4 Sec.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this wonderful piece of art lies not just in the engine, but in everything that meets the eye. The iconic Swan Wing Doors with Frame-less windows &amp; Double Laminated Glass are as impressive as the hand crafted Front Grille made out of Machined Aluminum. With 245/40 R20 tyres in front &amp; 295/35 R20 tyres in rear, the two stage adaptive &ldquo;Bilstein&rdquo; shock absorbers work effortlessly to ensure that the journey is smooth. With 6 Piston Caliper in the front &amp; 4 Piston Caliper at rear (both Dual Cast) along with Conventional Cast Iron Brake Rotors on all wheels, the power in efficiently controlled.</p>\n\n<p>English Cars ought to have the luxury and Rapide spells the magic with an all Alcantara Headlining, all interiors in Leather, using upto 10 Cowhides and a Bang &amp; Olufsen Music System.</p>\n\n<p>Impressed? Drop in at Big Boy Toyz &amp; we just might have one to offer!</p>\n",

The debate surrounding these revolutionary cars has heated up to its boiling point and is likely to intensify in the next few months, if not years. So keeping all our emotions aside, we&#39;ve decided to compare these titans of industry on facts and figures alone and see which one comes out ahead!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three hyper cars are fairly similar in their potential to amaze and entertain. There&#39;ve also been introduced into the market broadly at the same time, which makes you wonder what the engineers at the respective companies were thinking! And keeping up with the whole energy conservation initiative, all three cars are hybrids which make them extremely economical and good for the environment. But unlike conventional hybrids these hyper hybrids combine the performance of their petrol engines with their electric motor, giving you some serious power. Put all three together and you&#39;ve got an insane combined total of 2740 bhp.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h1 style=\"float: left; width: 100%; margin-top: 20px;\"><b>Battle of the titans: Performance</b></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The McLaren P1</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McLaren&#39;s petrol-electric P1 is driven by a highly-tuned 727 bhp 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 engine, coupled with a 176bhp lightweight electric motor, giving a total output of 903 bhp.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On its way to a top speed of 349 km/h, the rear-wheel drive McLaren will accelerate from 0-100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds, 0-200 km/h in 6.8 seconds and 0-300 km/h in 16.5 seconds.

So if you&#39;re choosing from your heart than it would have to be the Ferrari and if you&#39;re choosing from your mind than the McLaren would have an edge. But if you&#39;re Richard Hammond it would have to be the Porsche. Period!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>Let&#39;s face it, when you&#39;re looking for a nice summer holiday location, Germany would probably not be your idea of a great holiday destination. The weather is not great, the food is lousy, the beer sucks and the people&hellip; well let&#39;s just say they aren&#39;t the friendliest in the west. The odd occasion when you do meet an English speaking traveller, there would be two reasons for him/her for visiting Germany, and both of them have to do with speed. The first is the N&uuml;rburgring, a race track that some say is possibly the most treacherous in the world, testing both car and driver to their absolute limit. The second is the Autobahn: Germany&#39;s own playground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Autobahn is a driver&#39;s paradise. The no-speed limit roads are as flat as a pan and as straight as an arrow, letting ordinary drivers test their race mode skills. But to understand the Autobahn a bit better one has to briefly delve into its history. Ever since its introduction in the 1920s, when Germany woke up to the realisation that motorways advocate the idea of administration, commerce and industry. The Autobahn was born as a symbol towards a more progressive lifestyle, where car could get up to top speed &ndash; unobstructed by horse-drawn vehicles, children playing on the roads and dusty gravel surfaces. Over the year the Autobahn has grown considerably, connecting more and more cities and towns in Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Germany most things have an eerie organised nature about them, and the roads are no different. Although there is plenty of fun to be had, the possibility of returning home aggravated with a glove compartment full of traffic violations is also quite real. So in-order for you to have a memorable drivers experience we have listed a few tips that you should consider before you go road tripping in Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li>Beware of the speed limit: No not the maximum speed limit, but the Autobahn has a minimum speed limit that all vehicles must comply with to be legally fit. For historical reasons the lower speed limit is set to 60 km/h, and although you are allowed to drive this slow, you&#39;d be suicidal for trying. Most cars travel at about 200 km/h, so your best bet would be to have at least a BMW 3 series or even a VW Passat, which would help you really enjoy the roads.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\" style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li>In Germany faster is better: Most German cars are limited to 250 km/h mainly due to cost reasons, so picking up a German car would be ideal. A very common rental car is the Porsche 911 which is a fun car to drive. The Porsche doesn&#39;t have to contend with the annoying limiter, so with that out of the way you can really enjoy the German roads to their limit.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\" style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li>Once you have shortlisted your car it is extremely important to not tinker with it. Long stretches of high speed travel put a lot of strain on mechanical moving parts. Take tyres as an example, after continuous use tyres can get extremely hot and stretched and may eventually lead to the tyre bursting, which won&#39;t end well at 200 km/p. There is a reason why German cars are well known for their reliability; and its best to take their word for it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\" style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li>Trust a German: If tinkering is what you live for, then make sure you take it to a German authorised garage to do the tinkering for you. Take AMG for instance, they will remove all the limiters for you but at the same time upgrade your suspension and a host of other parts to ensure that your car is 100% safe at high speeds. Germans are absolute sticklers when it comes to quality and reliability and spend a lot of money and time making sure of that. So aftermarket exhaust system or low profile tyres may look good, but are just not going to cut it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\" style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li>Fill up quickly: With the car being constantly red-lined to its rpm limit, you will burn a lot of fuel in the process. For the sake of comparative analysis, a car that gives you a fuel economy of 10 km/l running under normal driving conditions will probably give you about 2-3 km/l on the Autobahn. What you absolutely don&#39;t want is your car to run out of fuel in the middle of the motorway. Fill her up as soon as the fuel warning light comes on. If you don&#39;t have a fuel station close by, drive economically till you find the next station.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The Autobahn will offer you an on-road experience unlike any you&#39;ve had before. With German cars known for their quality craftsmanship, the Autobahn completes this ultimate driving equation and is a testament for great German engineering. And with on-road amenities and the beautiful German countryside flying past you, the Autobahn experience is literally life in the fast lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>Alfa Romeo has been around for over a century now, and like its contemporaries has seen its share of ups and downs. But what makes the Alfa special is the fact that it&#39;s had a history in automobile motorsport excellence seldom ever seen. Since its inception this little known car manufacturer has competed successfully in many different categories of motorsport, including Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sports car racing, touring car racing, and rallies. So you may ask, what does Alfa Romeo bring to the Automobile Industry? After all, not many people have heard of this manufacturer or seen many of its cars. Well the simple answer is &#39;engineering excellence&#39;. Engineering excellence that&#39;s come after years of trial and learning at all motorsport stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the delight of many motoring enthusiast, Alfa Romeo recently introduced the 4C. Before explaining what the 4C is let&#39;s first understand what this car isn&#39;t. The 4C isn&#39;t a high performance supercar. You won&#39;t find any of the V8 or V12 engines loaded with superchargers here, essentially none of the stuff that a Bugatti Veyron or a Ferrari 458 is made of. What you do get is a lightweight giant killer. The 4C has a power to weight ratio of 3.85kg/bhp taking it from 0-100 km/h in a staggering 5 seconds. Putting cars way above its spec list to shame. So how does it achieve great performance while being minimalistic and simple? We will discover the secrets behind Alfa&#39;s lightweight engineering, in this article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lightweight Vehicle Architecture:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep the 4C ultra light, Alfa engineers utilized technologies and materials derived from Formula 1 and supercars. They began by designing a monocoque chassis made entirely of carbon fiber. Using the &quot;Pre Preg&quot; technology, where composite fibers are bonded together with components to make them ultra durable. Alfa went a step further and incorporated carbon fiber that runs in the same unilateral direction enabling it to be five times stronger. Around the monocoque chassis they used lightweight aluminium for the front and rear cell structures. This brilliance in engineering made the car lighter by up to 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exterior of the 4C is made entirely of SMC (Sheet Moulding Compound), the engineers used this low-density, high-strength composite material which is 20% lighter and far stronger than steel for the cars body. The bumpers and rear spoiler are injected with PUR-RIM (injected polyurethane) further saving weight by an additional 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another engineering marvel was the 4C&#39;s windshield and side windows. By using thinner lightweight glass the engineers were able to optimise the weight saving by an additional 15%. Finally two sports seats made entirely of carbon fiber and fibreglass composite offer the advantage of increased weight saving and agile drivability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In keeping with the 4C&#39;s ultra-lightweight design and desire for maximum manoeuvrability and road feel, the conventional power steering system is completely done away with. Replacing the power steering is a manual steering system, which keeps the driver in-touch with the road at all times. And thanks to the overall lightweight nature of the car, the appropriate steering-wheel load is maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alfa Romeo forever</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything about the 4C feels like it&#39;s been made keeping weight as the primary consideration. From its design to the feature that it has on offer, everything has a number. And unlike other cars this number in most cases is reflective of the weight of that specific part in question. So have they been successful in building a lightweight sports car. At an overall weight of just 1100kgs, I think they have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alfa Romeo&#39;s engineers are working hard at keeping the Alfa name alive. And with the introduction of the 4C they may have hit upon another winner. Now whether the 4C will be a market success, that is something that only time can tell. However one thing&#39;s for sure, Alfa has proved that they are the best of what is left in the purest of automobile engineering. And hopefully for all the auto enthusiast, they will stay that way for years to come.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>Imagine the scene; the year is 1961 and you&#39;re driving down the road on a Morris Oxford, travelling at a meagre 45 km/h. From behind you hear a sound which is unmistakably a V-12 engine. Even before you can turn around to see what&#39;s making that sound, a sleek looking car whizzes past you at an unbelievable speed. Now remember that this is 1961, where horse carriages were still amongst the popular mainstream modes of transportation. When the E-type was first introduced with much fanfare, it was poised to blow away people&#39;s perception about everything they&#39;d ever comprehended about the limitless possibilities that a car could present. To call the E-type ahead of its time would be a gross understatement; I think the word more apt would be iconic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast-forward half a century, and the E-type still mesmerises enthusiast and caters to an ever growing fan following. With looks, pace, power, engineering and heritage, the Jag offers everything you&#39;d want from a quality sports car, all with the added benefit of being relatively affordable. After all at the time of its launch, the E-type did cost as little as &pound;2,400, which in today&#39;s terms would be around &pound;30,000; still very good value for what you are getting. This gave an opportunity to the average middle income Joe driving a Morris Oxford, who now believes that one day he would have the opportunity to proudly drive alongside a Ferrari or Porsche in his red E-type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vital Stats:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: left;\">\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Engine</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>3781 cc/6-cyl/DOHC</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Power</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>265bhp@5500rpm</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Torque</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>260lb ft@4000rpm</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Top speed</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>150mph</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>0-100 km/h</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>6.9secs</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Economy</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>18mpg</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Gearbox</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>4-speed manual</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buying a Jaguar E-type</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jaguar E-type is no longer in production, so a used E-type today is what you will have to contend with. During its time there were quite a few E-type&#39;s sold, but finding one today maybe a little more difficult. Nevertheless picking the right one could be the difference between making a great investment or buying a money pit. Here are some things that you should be on the look-out before you buy one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Body:</strong> It&#39;s best to get someone else&#39;s restoration project, so don&#39;t buy the very first E-Type you find. When buying a car that&#39;s been restored, ask if you can find photos of the restoration project and also keep in mind to query about what parts of the car were restored. Stay clear of anything with a new coat of paint unless there is good documentation of proper restoration work associated with it. Bonnets are extremely expensive, so check that enormous panel carefully for any damage. Floors will rot if water ingress has been allowed unchecked, so check carpets for dampness and window seals for signs of ageing. The forward chassis rails are important for strength, so check thoroughly for any rot or accidental damage. The door sills are also an essential part of the structure, especially on open cars. Don&#39;t forget to examine the hood; they don&#39;t come cheap with a replacements one coming around &pound;250. It is important to keep in mind that a restoration projects may be temptingly cheap, and will definitely raise the value of your car, however expenses can soon escalate out of control.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\" style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Gearbox &amp; Engine</strong>: The E-type&#39;s engine might be costly to overhaul - &pound;4000 or maybe more contingent upon what&#39;s required &ndash; so keep an ear out for any bottom-end knocks. Also ensure that you stay away from a car with excessive blue exhaust smoke, because that could lead to a sizeable investment to fix. Keep an eye on the temperature gauge and keep clear of creamy deposits beneath the oil filler cap, suggesting a leaking head gasket. Timing chains can rattle and are challenging to reset as they choose shims, slightly noisy is best, very quiet suggests they&#39;re too tight. Watch out for US imports &ndash; due to emission controls standards some had as low as 171 bhp.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The manual gearboxes are fairly robust, but watch for any crunching noises when changing which would suggest a weak synchromesh. Autos (2+2 only) are not the more popular choice but when it comes to reliability, are the better option. Changes on the E-type were never super-smooth, but excessive jolts indicate a worn gearbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\" style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Interiors and Electricals:</strong> Don&#39;t ignore the expenditure of reviving a tired interior. The full re-trim could easily cost &pound;2000 or more. Mazda MX-5 seats have been noticed in E-Types, but they&#39;re certainly not right for the car. Electrics are ok bar the usual dirty connections, but dont hesitate to ask whether a restored car has been rewired &ndash; replacing the loom can be a very time and energy consuming process.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s amazing that the designers at Jaguar came up with such an astoundingly good looking car 50 years ago. Today&#39;s cars are designed with state of the art technology and pin-point accurate AutoCAD. Nevertheless compare the E-type with any new car, and the old E-type beats it hands down. Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear calls the E-type &quot;the last great thing made by Britain&quot;. And although you may have heard horror stories about the E-type, especially about its tendency to break down when you least expect. The E-type does do one thing just right, it keeps everything simple. Makes you wonder whether the best days of automotive engineering are over, or maybe they just reached their pinnacle 50 years ago.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>It all started with the sports car. And with the likes of Ferrari and Porsche the possibilities of automobile engineering seemed limitless. Soon after the supercar was introduced; and with manufactures pushing the envelope on automobile engineering even further the definition of supercars became a little hazy. Until the introduction of the Bugatti Veyron in the early 2000s. This car was totally in a league of its own, dominating all automotive benchmarks set by other well known manufacturer of its time. Thus the hypercar was born, and with manufacturers like Ferrari and Lamborghini unable to keep up, this car was on top of its game for the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now, with the introduction of the Koenigsegg Agera One: 1, the world&#39;s first &#39;megacar&#39;. The engineers at Koenigsegg have broken the limits of hypercar possibilities by creating a car that goes beyond and sets a new benchmark on automotive speed and excellence. Completely destroying the hypercar. The One: 1 is not a car; it&#39;s a road bound rocket ship. Stealthy and swift, everything about this car has an innately inimitable feel about it. The name for instance has been derived by its power to weight ratio. The car produces 1340 bhp and weighs just 1340 kg; hence one kilogram for every horsepower, which in itself is an absolutely unbelievable feat. With a claimed top speed of more than 440 km/h, and acceleration capable to hit 400 km/s, the One: 1 is all set to hit the record books as being the fastest car in the world. Another aspect of this car is that it is super-rare. Even before its launch the One: 1 sold-out all of its 6 units making this car a legend in the makings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Koenigsegg Agera One: 1 stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Engine</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>5.0L V8, 4 valves per cylinder</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Power output (HP @ RPM)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>1340 @ 7,500</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Max torque</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>1,011 lbs-ft @ 6000 rpm</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Acceleration 0-400 KM/H</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>20 Sec</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>400 - 0 km/h</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>10 Sec</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>100-0 KM/H Braking distance</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>28 Meters (91.9 Ft)</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Lateral G-force</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>2.0 G</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Weight distribution</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>44% front, 56% rear</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine powering this mega car is a twin-turbocharged, 5.0-liter V8 that generates a massive 1,341 bhp and 1,011 pound-feet of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox and electronically-controlled differential makes sure all the power gets transferred to the wheels. Its features sound like props from a science fiction movie like variable geometry turbos in custom, 3D-printed housings and a 3D-printed titanium exhaust. And although this car seems built for achieving its top speed, Koenigsegg say that the One: 1 is more of a track day car. All thanks to the riding aids that are built into the body improving cornering capabilities and increasing down force. In addition to these aids, things like the ride height, dampers and spring rates all adjust automatically according to the speed of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall weight of the One: 1 is another aspect of this car which is quite fascinating and adds to the performance. With extensive use of carbon fibre, the One:1 tips the scales at 1360kg relatively around the same as small hatchback. To put this into some perspective the lightweight One:1 has an engine which is about 10-12 times more powerful than a similar weighted hatchback. As the name suggest, this cars power to weight ratio truly raises the bar of performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Styling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The designers at Koenigsegg have made all the possible effort to make the One:1 as aerodynamically sound as possible. That in the One:1 looks more like a alien space craft than a road-legal car. One of the most prominent parts of the One:1 is the rear wing which gives the best combination of downforce, drag and braking. This car also features two large intercoolers on the sides which not only add to the aesthetics but are also functional by helping to optimise the cooling. The only other car that comes close, when it comes to styling and aerodynamics is the Pagani Zonda.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>What you&#39;ll love</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>What you wont</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Brutal power to weight ration</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Price</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Aesthetics</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Extremely limited numbers</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>The next generation of automobile engineering</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style=\"padding-right: 20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Won&#39;t hold the Guinness record due to limited numbers</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why Koenigsegg decided to go with only 6 cars is anyone&#39;s guess. But I think what most motoring enthusiast would be thinking about is whether the One:1 can beat the Veyron Sport and take the Guinness records away from the French. Well unfortunately that seems like a distant possibility as the rules for Guinness stipulate that a minimum of 30 production cars have to be rolled out off the production line in-order for a car to qualify. And with the One:1 limiting its production to just 6, that won&#39;t be happening anytime soon. Nevertheless with the One:1 the automotive industry seems to have taken a quantum leap forward and it&#39;s only a matter of time before we see the next big leap forward.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>You&#39;d be excused it you got the name of Porsche&#39;s new Double Clutch technology wrong. Thankfully the folks at Porsche avoided this perplexity by giving it a neat acronym, the PDK. It all started with a man called Adolph K&eacute;gresse, who was considered a pioneer in the automotive industry. The PDK system was first developed by him for racing cars only. But over the subsequent decades was gradually introduced into the 911 models. Its success was so phenomenal that <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche\">Porsche</a></strong> then decided to introduce it into most of its road legal cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask most auto enthusiasts about the choice of gear-box they would prefer and most would opt for a conventional manual. But with the introduction of the PDK system, you&#39;d definitely see a few of those heads turn. The PDK is hands down the best dual clutch system in production today. Gear changes are smooth and swift and driving is an exhilarating experience. What makes the PDK better than the other systems is its responsiveness and even in slow speeds it allows the driver to swap between gears effortlessly. Changing between &#39;R&#39; and &#39;D&#39; is simple and feels silky smooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&#39;s the advantage of having a PDK system</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you get behind the wheel of a PDK driven car you will instantaneously notice the speed. Gear changes happen almost effortlessly with no loss of power between gear changes. Cars which come equipped with the PDK system have shown a 12-15% improvement in overall speed as compared to their manual counterparts. All this translate to faster lap timings and not to mentioned better fuel economy. And in today&#39;s day and age we all know how important that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does the PDK system work</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PDK gearbox is a clever piece of engineering. It uses two clutches instead of the one found in most cars. The two clutch system operates alternately and sequentially i.e. one clutch operates on even numbered gears while the other operates the odd numbered gears. Essentially the next gear is preselected even before the driver selects the gear. This enables the car to move between gears quicker than 100ms. Moreover the PDKs sensor input system checks shifting at inopportune times, like when cornering on sharp turns. And unlike most single clutch cars the PKD uses two sets of lubrication for the clutch and the gearbox, making them independent of from another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ease of driving for many has been what they intuitively expect, in that sense the manual gear-box is still the better alternative. However that doesn&#39;t hold true thanks to the pinpoint accuracy and lightning fast responses of the PDK system. The PDK offers the Porsche drivers the best of both worlds.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>The Weekend is here and your idea of fun is to take your lovely new 4&times;4 off the beaten track. The off-road is the ideal playground for your vehicle as it tests the strength of its off-road capabilities. A test between machine and nature, with both wrestling each-other to the inch of their lives. But what happens when one of them is victorious. You either go home happy, feeling like a king returning from a conquest of foreign lands or you have a sinking stuck in the mud kind of feeling (quite literally). To avoid this bitter experience, there are a number of things that you should keep in-mind before buying your next offroader; and torque is definitely one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Torque</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most off-road vehicles come with oodles of torque. Before we understand how it helps your large SUVs and 4&times;4s to move forward let&#39;s first understand what torque really is. Torque is a measure of the amount of force acting on an object causing that object to rotate; or to put it in simpler terms, torque is the amount of turning (rotating) power your vehicle has. Now that we have understood torque, how does it help rotate the four wheels of your car? And, is more torque necessarily better? For instance let&#39;s say your car comes with 200 foot-pounds of torque. Take a torque wrench (found in most hardware shops) and then apply a force of 200 pounds. As a result you would have 200 foot-pounds of torque on display. The difference between torque and horsepower is that torque is the ability of your car to do work; horsepower is the rate at which it does it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"width: 100%;\"><strong>Limited slip-differential </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A limited slip-differential also know as diff, is a mechanical device which is connected to the drivetrain of your vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diff uses this torque which it collects from the drive train and distributes it equally between all four wheels. In the event of one of the four wheels getting stuck, the diff will temporarily disable power to this wheel and transfer this power to the remaining wheels which have better traction. Thereby limiting the capacity of that one wheel to spin out of control while the other three wheels have better grip. This feature allows vehicles (especially the off-road type) to tackle tracks easily and enhances their off-roading capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two pictures above show a car with and without a limited slip differential. Notice the tread pattern on the image below which indications traction from all four wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Automatic limited slip-differential</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initial the limited slip-differential came in its mechanical form, but over the years manufacturers have developed the limited slip differential and come up with automatic (ALSD) versions of the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ALSD works in tandem with the traction control system to reduce wheel spin in much the same way a manual one does. However the ALSD uses the cars onboard sensors to overcome the common flaws of locking, enabling your car to apply more traction when you most need it.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>Great news for auto enthusiasts, the much awaited Autonomous cars are no longer a dream. They are real now and no more just in the realm of science fiction and the day when you see them on roads, maybe sooner than you think. Autonomous or automated cars are also known as driverless, self-driving and robotic cars have been in the pipeline as the next big thing in Automobiles. The computation and sensing capabilities are so highly designed by the engineers of the automobile industry that they can sense their surroundings and operate themselves without any human interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 21st century, technology has reached such a level that everything has become computerised. Whether it&#39;s a car or any other handheld or computer device, everything has a computer driven interface to control or guide it along its way. High-end car brands such Audi, BMW, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, etc have jumped onto this bandwagon by employing tech-savvy engineers to make use of autonomous technology and provide the consumers with the best possible car driving experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So what is the concept behind autonomous cars, and why is it getting so much press ?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Autonomous vehicles have the potential to sense the surroundings by making use of cutting-edge technology such as radars, GPS, computer vision, etc. This technology aims to increase the safety aspect while driving super luxurious cars thereby nullifying any scope of on-road accidents. The advanced technology incorporated in these autonomous vehicles ensures appropriate identification of the navigation parts by interpreting sensory information such as signages, the road milestones, the surrounding environment and more. And with the help of the internet, these automated vehicles get updated on a regular basis thanks for the integrated on board maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the time being , these cars are only available as prototypes. Before launching these cars, the engineers are still working on getting them polished and with as much advanced technology as possible. Especially since automated systems are building blocks that are responsible for keeping the passengers safe and navigating the car safely. Autonomous vehicles have control systems that are embedded into the artificial intelligence of these cars, that are capable of sensing and identifying various problems in advance to save lives. Technical teams are also working on their sensory systems that never lose track even in the changing environmental conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not just any random technology, there have been a lot of research, implications and trials done before concluding on to any result hence such technology can be a big social and economic boon. By making use of such a technology the automobile industry can be transformed into something more prominent just like smartphones are going smarter, likewise the auto industry is also taking things to next level and making things more comfortable, safer, environment friendly for car lovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some basic advantages and disadvantages of these superfast mean machines that are intelligent enough to drive you to your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages of automated vehicles:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As these vehicles will be taking over the market in the upcoming years, there would be many benefits for the people driving in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li>1. The number of accidents and collision would be reduced in large numbers.</li>\r\n\t<li>2. You would not face any more heavy traffic jams.</li>\r\n\t<li>3. Less pollution or no pollution.</li>\r\n\t<li>4. Better emergency handling systems (as no emotional interference)</li>\r\n\t<li>5. Management and tracking would be simply easy and fast.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Disadvantages of automated vehicles:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we all know, everything comes with a price of risks, nothing in this world has freedom from risks. Hence, there are some heavy risks that are possible in automated machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"float: left; width: 100%;\">\r\n\t<li>1. Technical issues, that can take place any time; after all it&#39;s a machine.</li>\r\n\t<li>2. System crashes are also possible.</li>\r\n\t<li>3. Hacking is a major issue due to software-based automated systems</li>\r\n\t<li>4. The possibility of disasters is also there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, this is just the first step forward towards an improvement which could rapidly turn into an avalanche. Around two years ago, the concept of automated vehicles were broadly viewed as unrealistic; on the other hand, at present it is clear that it is now a matter of couple of years and you would be driving them on the roads without any hesitations. At this time, the perspective is still irresistible that self-driving innovation will do little to change the way of autos and the way of versatility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, a more intensive look uncovers that the innovation will prompt key change from cars that are owned to the cars that will be servicing you and will save on the usage of fossil fuel energies and will fully use electrical energy. These central changes open many doors. Right now is an ideal opportunity to take them.</p>\r\n",

While many of us have seen Agent 007 blaze around in Aston Martin&rsquo;s over the years, the British automotive brand is seldom discussed in peer groups, with its German and Italian counterparts basking all the limelight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having had the pleasure of recently visiting Big Boy Toyz at M.G. Road who provide pre-owned Aston Martin cars, this peerless beauty of a car has caught my fancy like never before! The other thing that I observed during that visit was that the folks at BBT not only understand the lineage of the brand, they endorse it very religiously! The used Aston Martin cars they have on offer are well maintained from the inside out, with attention to each and every tiny detail. In fact, they are so spic and span, that if you were to see one of them on the road, you are most likely to pass them off as practically brand new!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aston Martins are unparalleled in the context that not only are they impressive on the performance front, they possess an iconic cinematic legacy which is practically unrivaled. While the brand came into being in 1913, it was only by 1947 that the ship steadied under the leadership of Sir David Brown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The love affair between the flamboyant and suave spy and the indigenously luxurious sports car began in 1964 with the &lsquo;Gold finger&rsquo; where Sean Connery drove the Aston Martin DB 5. Since then, both the spy and the machine of his choice have evolved, with the likes of V8 Vantage, Vanquish and DBS gracing the screen. The last movie in the franchise, Daniel Craig starrer &lsquo;Sky fall&rsquo; (2012) was an ode to the original DB 5 and its beautiful fine lines as he drove the beauty all the way back to his home in Scotland. And if spy shots are to be believed, then the upcoming &lsquo;Spectre&rsquo; will boast of the latest in line DB10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While that might have refreshed the 007-Aston Martin combination over the years, the essence of this relationship has been the rise in prominence of a sports car brand unlike any other. And it doesn&#39;t show any signs of waning!</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The world is in motion. We are in motion. And motion has always meant something exciting. Expression of concept does not get complicated but when the two most important words gets crowded out by their shouty and loudy neighbors, then they are undoubtly called as &ldquo;Super Cars&rdquo; written in bold, enlarged, indelible type.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">But still some of you must have a question, a question that riddles everyone a lot and that is,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Has the Future of the Super Car arrived?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In 2014 this answer was fruitfully answer by BMW, by introducing its new BMW i8. The i8 is the new age sports car. So new age that its engineers refuse to say how it does against the old-age sports cars. It can be said that it is the &ldquo;Sports Car for the real and Futuristic World&rdquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">BMW i is the far reaching and ground breaking concept for perfect mobility, presenting visionary electric vehicles and networked services, inspiring design and a new understanding of what premium means. BMW have given the proof that sustainability and pure driving pleasure can complement each other perfectly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">While McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder and LaFerrari have hogged all the hype around hybrid supercars, all three use electric motors to aid large-capacity petrol engines. The i8 is much more innovative&hellip;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The BMW i8 boasts a tiny turbocharged three-cylinder engine that drives the rear wheels &ndash; its way more efficient than the V8s and V12s you&rsquo;ll find in those million Dollar hybrid supercars. The mid-mounted petrol engine is BMW&rsquo;s new 1.5-litre triple and a twin-scroll turbo helps it produce 228bhp and accelerates from 0-100 in 4.4 seconds. When unleashing its full power it can reach upto a speed of 250Km/h. The new BMW i8 switches to all-electric drive at the touch of a button for a top speed of 120km/h very easily.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The new i8 is the best example of BMW&rsquo;s engineering and has by far the best integrated hybrid system. It obviously catches your eye whether you are driving any other sports car, people will surely stop by or slow-down will take a second, third look may sometimes have selfies with the car. And if we talk about the styling part then it has truly &lsquo;Nailed it&rsquo;</span></p>\r\n",

McLaren will be launching the sports car in the market to target Porsche 911 and Mercedes Benz AMG GT, they are planning to do so by their internally known model P13.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The 500S is expected to have a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 engine tuned to around 500hp and will be similar to the size of P1 and 650S since it shares the same carbon fiber chassis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">This was not it; the most interesting thing is that McLaren is already planning to build a near-supercar P15 model and a 650S replacement that&rsquo;s currently codenamed P16. Some sources say that the McLaren 500S can arrive in coupe form next year, along with a possible 650S GTS model, the sources being unofficial. The 500S Spider and the P1 GTR are expected to be <a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>available in 2016 while the P16 coupe will come in 2017.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">There may be a possibility that a GTS variant for the 500S may arrive in 2018 to spice up the linup, along with the Spider variant for the P16. So looking up in the future we can expect a lot more &ldquo;Thrill&rdquo; in the supercar market.</span></p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The whole English Language falls short when describing the sensation of â€œacquaintingâ€ oneself with the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport and its 16-cylinder, eight-liter engine. The force is so violent that the mind becomes blank, time and space becomes distorted in a way that only the astronauts during the liftoffs or the Formulae1 drivers while leaving the grid can understand. You will feel as if you are having an out of the body experience or being sucked by the jet plane.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">Bugatti Veyronâ€™s birth wasnâ€™t an easy one; it came into existence because of a dream to provide the world with the car that had 1000bhp, cost 1 million euros and could do over 400Km/h.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sportâ€™sÂ seven-gear, twin-clutch gearbox is the first to master comparably high torque values. With 16 cylinders, a combined capacity of 8 litres, 4 valves per cylinder and four turbo chargers, the Grand Sportâ€™s engine is the most powerful ever to be built into a production vehicle. The car not only excels in acceleration but also in the braking system from â€œFaster to Full-Stopâ€, i.e. from 100 to 0 Km/h in 2.3 seconds Â and less than 10 seconds from 407 to a full standstill. Â At velocities exceeding 200 km/h, the rear spoiler serves as additional air brake. Activated by the brake pedal, the spoiler shoots up and allows the car to come to a full stop.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The car catches 0-100 Km/h in 2.7 seconds, it has written history in the automotive industry by reaching to such high performance values. The technical equipment of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand SportÂ is in a class of its own, delivering unforgettable sound and comfort at any speed, even with the top open. The audio system â€œPucciniâ€, designed especially for a convertible car, features a digital signal processor as well as a series of interfaces for numerous external devices, including the iPod.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Grand Sport with its roof off adds an ultimate aspect to the driving experience as the engines and the air intakes are inches away from your head and the Turbos greedily gurgling away, a constant reminder that you are piloting something between a plane, a college education and a Formula 1 car.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The challenge that Bugatti took to develop a roadster that would unite previously unattained features in one exceptional vehicle was exceptionally attained.</span></p>",

The answer to the question is answered by the Porsche Cayman S, a car which is so overwhelmingly brilliant in all what I sets out to do that is could just &nbsp;be the worlds&#39; best in its category!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">There&#39;s a lot you can say about the Cayman S. It&#39;s handsome. It&#39;s well-built. It&#39;s expensive. But if you we<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>re to ask us for one word to sum up the mid-engined, 2-seat coupe, it would be easy to choose: Outstanding!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Cayman born out of the iconic Boxter isn&rsquo;t just a car with a roof but a lot more than that, this one is beautifully crafted with a real sense of solidity and sculpture and have a 3.4L horizontally opposed, 6 cylinders engine. With a 5 Speed Tiptronic S Transmission and 340 Nm @ 4400-6000 rpm Peak Torque, this Cayman S can be termed is Perfection Personified. The Cayman especially shines when you drive it quickly around corners. Like most mid-engine cars, it&#39;s tremendously well-balanced, largely because the heavy engine sits near the center of the car and doesn&#39;t skew weight distribution to the front or rear.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">A design is either fascinating or functional. The front and rear lights of the Cayman models can be both. The Cayman S is equipped as standard with Bi-Xenon (TM)&nbsp;headlights. The interiors of the car will make you feel right at home, everything is focused on advancing with a blend of sport and comfort. In the Cayman S, the door armrests and the storage compartment lid on the center console are also finished in leather as standard. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The optional leather package enhances the interior of your Cayman with additional items finished in leather. Another special feature of Cayman is its BOSE surround sound system which delivers a balanced acoustic pattern and a soothing sound. The top track speed recorded of Cayman S is 267Km/h.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It will be a terrific car to own and that is for sure. It rides well, is quiet and smooth and easy to live with, particularly with that practical hatchback rear and deep front boot. And if you are really interested in buying this supercar then you should contact Big Boy Toyz which deals in such Pre-Owned exotics. This customer centered organization offers commendable services and buying from them would seriously be a good experience.</span></p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">From Batman-1 to Batman-2, then from Charlie&rsquo;s Angels to Fast and the Furious, or may it be Forrest Gump or The Godfather I-II. The list is endless, Cadillac, have a long, storied history, beginning with its first model in 1902. It has been used in most famous movies of the Era of Hollywood.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The name Cadillac is one of the oldest names in the world of premium automotive and had its ups and downs over more than 100 years of its existence. After the long period they introduced their one of their best modals, Cadillac CTS. The first CTS marked the production debut of Cadillac&#39;s edgy &quot;Art and Science&quot;. The second version of CTS was a new proposition. It made its mark with its amazing engine and its performance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Now comes the third generation CTS, which displays an impressive balance of performance and styling. A truly dramatic presence can be seen in its highly responsive 3.6L direct injection engine. May it be the body-side profile, roofline, or it lamps &ndash; everything takes a distinctive stand.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The signature vertical tail-lamps are more efficient and long lasting. The best thing about the car is that the Adaptive remote Start allows the CTS engine to start more than 50 yards away. Even the interior climate is also preconditioned with the external temperature. The BOSE surround sound system gives a smooth and rich sound, no matter what are you&rsquo;re listening to.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If you know how much its competitors cost then you should seriously know how much a CTS costs. It&rsquo;s worth every penny. Cadillac has been promising that they&#39;d be the standard of the world for more than a decade now, and it&#39;s finally true. This is the best car in the Cadillac lineup; I think it&#39;s even the best car in its class.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a luxury that, once you&rsquo;ve experienced it, will feel like a necessity.</span></p>\r\n",

A powerhouse of a luxury car, Rolls Royce has always been an epitome of grandeur of the highest scale, in India as well as abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A royal countenance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to automobile historian Mr. John M. Faisal, Rolls Royce possesses royal legacy in the Indian context, as approximately 900 Rolls-Royce cars were sold to Indian princes before 1947.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether it be the very first Rolls-Royce made famous as the &lsquo;Pearl of the East&rsquo;, and bought by Maharaja Pratap Singh Gaekwar of Baroda after World War II or the custom-made Rolls Royce New Phantom Torpedo Sports Tourer of &lsquo;Maharaja of Kota&rsquo; Umed Singh II, who used to hunt tigers in this exotic automobile, Rolls Royce had a mesmerizing effect on the Indian princes during the first four decades of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Interestingly, the &lsquo;Maharaja of Mysore&rsquo; always bought Rolls-Royces in batches of seven that got famous as the parlance &lsquo;doing a Mysore&rsquo; which meant selling seven cars at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the &lsquo;Nizam of Hyderabad&rsquo; had 50 Rolls-Royces in a row, out of which a silver Ghost still has the original paint. At the time of his death in 1967, Many of these cars had barely done 1000 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The best there is</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rolls Royce cars travel less in comparison to other luxury cars. However, regardless of its age, a Rolls Royce characterizes elegance and luxury with its uncompromising standards. The fact that each and every Rolls Royce, be it a Phantom, Ghost or the Wraith, each and every car that comes out of RR&rsquo;s production stable is custom-made to the last stitch. Why, because a Rolls Royce is an affluent lifestyle statement at its purest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With its plush and reinvigorating interiors, unmatchable engineering and design lines that transcend time, Rolls Royce sits on an undisputed pedestal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Pre-owned Rolls Royce cars that we have at Big Boy Toyz boasts of the same &lsquo;Spirit of Ecstasy&rsquo;. And with each Rolls Royce having its own distinctive features, you can feel proud about the fact that the Rolls Royce you own is well and truly unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With our wide array of used Rolls Royce cars, grace the roads with an opulence bar none.</p>\r\n",

Most of the times after a lot of confusion people do spend money but do they spend in a way they actually wanted?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s come to people who have big dreams to buy a car like Audi, Mercedes, Lamborghinis, etc. Obviously they need a huge investment to do. So what about them? All of us need ROI form whatever we invest. They want an option for a proper investment. What if a person wants to buy an Aston Martin Virage which is a limited edition car in India, or any other limited edition car. So, I discovered some of the organizations which deals with pre owned cars in India. There are many such organizations that do this business, an organizations came into light named &quot;Big Boy Toyz&quot;. This organization provides with great deals in different segments of cars like sports, luxury, sedans etc. and deals with very big and reputed brands like Mercedes, Lamborghini, Audi, and BMW etc. (which we call as imported cars). I came across through their website and found that they offer cars at a affordable price and with very good after sales services. The points that attracted me to BBT were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Price<br />\r\n- Quality maintenance<br />\r\n- Brands they offer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inventory of BBT is very good. For example, they provided their customer a very decent and obviously marvelous Ferrari spider gaining the attention of customers. These are some features which forced me to check out the BBT&#39;s inventory. Just have a look and see what BBT can offer you. Something&#39;s should be tried. So take a chance and go for it.</p>\r\n",

Throughout the film audience were treated to the sweeping shots of the iconic Aston Martin, Land Rovers, and the beautiful Jaguar XJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of them were at their best but Jaguar was seen as the eye catcher. The car was used by Judi Dench (M&#39;s Company car) and even by James Bond himself. The car is a dramatic combination of beauty, luxury and power and more to it the car has a class same like of &quot;James Bond&quot;. As a driver or a passenger you&#39;ll discover a quality of craftsmanship that sets the car part with the carefully considered choices of colors, materials and finishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car is extraordinary from the front till the rear end with the classical Jaguar logo in front and the dramatically tapered taillight with 3-LED lines vertically making it look like a Cats claw, and if it&#39;s in black imagine that dark shiny look&hellip; Woooow !!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another special feature about the car is Bowers &amp; Wilkins 440 Watts audio system with 14 speakers and Dynamic Volume control. The car is on aluminum chassis weighing it lighter than any other of its competitor cars. It comes with a 3.0 L, V6, 275 BHP Diesel engine and more BHP in the petrol one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior comprises of a fine leather work even the dash has a leather work, and the dashboard is straight unlike other cars which makes the interior look more classic and amazing. The beauty of the XJL is more than skin-deep, its aluminum construction is exceptionally strong yet light, with near perfect front-to-rear weight distribution. The advanced body structure also helps the car to achieve better fuel economy than it would with a heavier steel structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The luxurious comfort envelops you as soon as you enter the Jaguar with the long legroom and with the business trays. The car delivers a refreshingly dynamic driving experience. No car looks, or feels like XJL.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>Technology keeps changing and so do desires. It&#39;s our desires that give way for inventions. Many automobile companies do tinker about and create newer, more efficient ways to improve their performance and enhance their styling. Different people have different insights, but when a company wants to meet the satisfaction level of their customers, they need to make a product carrying a bundle of features, attracting car fanatics in one sitting and accelerate their satisfaction levels to heights they crave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nissan did an amazing job in this sector by launching &quot;Nissan&#39;s GT-R&quot;. An amazing and powerful ride which will make you feel like you are the only person who is driving the future while everybody else is still stuck in 1842.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you go for specifications, nothing comes close to the GT-R&#39;s 545 hp, 0-60 mph times of less than 3.0 seconds, or its brilliant all-wheel-drive handling. The GT-R doesn&#39;t lack for a possessing style, but it doesn&#39;t quite live up to iconic outlines of Astons, Ferraris or <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghinis</a>, either. Its jagged outline reads more tuner car, more body kit, than instant classic. The components cut interesting swaths across its luxury-coupe outline: a tomahawk cut at the roofline chops into the rear end, and carbon fiber trim gives the plain interior just a dab of intrigue--given more panache with the red-and-black Recaros in Black Series models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_GT-R\" target=\"_blank\">Nissan GT-R</a> has the safety equipment we expect to find in any modern luxury car, and some necessary features we routinely see now in sports cars and supercars. Features are as respectable as they can be without begging any mention of plush or luxurious (that it is not), but all the basics are included, as well as a great 3D navigation system, Bose audio, and Bluetooth. Take the Premium Interior package it goes a long way to correcting the inexpensive looking cockpit, the GT-R&#39;s most visible flaw and you&#39;ll have a grade luxury in a car with NASA grade acceleration.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>What comes to your mind when you see a bright color two seater on the road, a yellow or an orange roaring out loud in the crowd?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lamborghini&hellip;!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s something about seeing a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> on the road it derives a different response than any other supercar. Following on the same footsteps or I should rather say the &quot;Tiretracks&quot; the new Lamborghini should have the same effect that its predecessors&#39; had. They call it &quot;The instinct of the future&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gallardo has grown up and Lamborghini has created a car a car with all the style and noise that its customers want. This one has even big shoes to fill with the jaw-dropping design and the brutish performance. Whether you are crawling down the streets or hustling down the road or posting lap time down the tracks, this one needs to perform. This extreme looking sports car can hit 60 mph in just over there seconds, and can exceed over 200 mph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like its predecessors the name comes from the world of bullfighting, Huracan was a Spanish breed of bull that fought in the late 19th century. This exotic will be available by the name LP 610-4. Lamborghini&#39;s cars are like, &quot;The name speaks out everything&quot;. &quot;LP&quot; designation refers to the layout of the engine, the number 610 refers to horsepower, while the &quot;-4&quot; indicates the car is driven by all four wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart of this supercar is a 5.2L V8 engine producing 610 horsepower. The interiors of the car are comfortable and give you a high tech feel; the console has a diversity of switches and dials. The ultimate section is &#39;The red cover&#39; over that start-stop button that gives you a feel of firing a missile rather than starting an engine, and pushing it rewards the driver with a massive roar from the V10 engine as it comes to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://huracan.lamborghini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Huracan</a> is not a car for introverts. This beast draws a crowd every time it gets driven, and honestly that&#39;s part of the fun. Lamborghini have added an exclamation point with bright color choices of orange, green and yellow, thinking as if the car isn&#39;t noticeable itself. You don&#39;t have to be a professional driver to drive the new Huracan, this road-worthy supercar is enough for everyday use.</p>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>Forget all you know about speed, have you ever imagined how could be the whole new stratosphere of performance, a relentless accumulation of speed accompanied by the greatest automotive soundtrack in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be afraid, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> had been working on the most extreme production-derived car in its history: &quot;A hardcore, track-spec version of the heart pounding fast LaFerrari&hellip;!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferrari has staged the holy anticipated global premiere of its belated Enzo successor &#39;LaFerrari&#39;, which is the ultimate distillation of speed and means &quot;The Ferrari&quot; in Italian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The what? The Ferrari The Ferrari? Or just LaFerrari? Obviously it was an odd one for sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what it actually is? A limited addition 499-strong definitive statement from a company whose flagship cars have been nothing less than milestones in the automotive evolution &ndash; may it be a 1984&#39;s turbocharged 288 GTO, &#39;87&#39;s carbon fiber F40, &#39;95&#39;s F1 derived F50, and 2002&#39;s everything Enzo. It is seen that Ferrari&#39;s limited-edition cars are special. They come once in a decade, cost a small fortune; which has never hurt sales, and usually becomes the benchmark for the next-generations supercars at Ferrari and the entire industry. This Hyper car represents Ferrari&#39;s most ambitious project to push the boundaries of technology, drawing together the finest expression of the marque&#39;s technical capabilities in both GT and Formula 1 engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LaFerrari is the first ever car with hybrid technology to come out. The 6262cc V12 produces 800 CV and the electric motor a further 12o kW (163 CV) for a total of over 960 CV. Talking about the acceleration it has an ability to reach 0-200Km/h in less than 7 seconds, and it is not over yet, the maximum speed it can give is above 350Km/h. The cockpit of the car is developed with the direct involvement of F1 drivers resulting in the perfect fusion of the tradition and modernity and which is track inspired. The steering wheel and pedal box is highly adjustable as per the driver&#39;s preference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaFerrari is an intoxicating blend of earth-shattering performance and confidence-inspiring technology. A car with such high BHP shouldn&#39;t be easy to drive, but this one is. That&#39;s the genius of LaFerrari, which takes the concept of driver aids that heighten rather than blunt the experience and propels it into a new dimension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LaFerrari is the finest expression of the company&#39;s unique, unparalleled engineering and design know-how, including that acquired in <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Formula One</a>. The car was a high level gamble that could have failed. But really, the LaFerrari is just that. The Ferrari.</p>\r\n",

As far as I am concerned my satisfaction level leads to luxury. Until and unless my ride is luxurious enough to offer me proper satisfaction I&#39;ll not go for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many brands which offer you luxury vehicles like Mercedes, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a>, and Jaguar etc. but to select a proper one from these is a big issue. Availability is boon for customers but it also creates confusion. In earlier times we didn&#39;t have many options in our. But today different products serve different demands. My wish was to buy a luxury car and I ended up with buying a <a href=\"https://www.jaguarusa.com/all-models/xj/xj-models/xjl-portfolio.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jaguar XJL</a>, an amazing sedan with great features. Jaguar gave great features to this ride like fully leather furnished interiors, seat massager, ac vents in the seat and many more interesting features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I went to buy this car, my pocket didn&#39;t allow doing so. I was confused because I wanted to buy that ride. Then again I enquired about some organizations who deal in pre-owned exotic cars and I came to know about Big Boy Toyz (BBT). They deal with exotic, sports, premium cars and provide great deal to their customers. I went to BBT and got my ride. Obviously it was pre-owned but the condition was very good and most importantly satisfactory for me. They offered great services to me and maintain their word of keeping the quality in their vehicle. I was satisfied with my choice and had a great deal with BBT.</p>\r\n",

Some of them try to be as much realistic as possible, and shoot there scenes and put their characters in such situation that can happen to any of us in the real life. And then there are some sci-fi movies which specialize in the surreal, the out-of-proportion and the fantastic. In which usually a science experiment goes wrong and the boy-next-door becomes a Superhero or Supervillain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can happen to anybody, and by anybody I mean this can happen to Cars also. Now something like this happens in the in a town Affalterbach, located in Southern Germany, a home for AMG a Mercedes-Benz division, where they transform these Mercs into monsters. And once the metamorphosis is complete, they stick an AMG badge at the rear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has been sending these monsters to India for quite a long time, like the G63, the E63, and the SLK55. It wasn&#39;t enough for them so they planned to bring something new, a beast already, with enough muscle to scare the daylights out of you. This is the GL63 AMG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The handcrafted &#39;Heart&#39; of this GL makes him a beast. The 5.5-litre engine, aided by two turbos, is tuned to make 557bhp &ndash; more power than it makes in any other tune; Power that has the ability to pull Boeing 747, true story. No matter what speed you are driving, you accelerate and it will shoot like a missile. If you throttle and keep it that way, then you&#39;ll reach 0-100Kmph in less than 5 seconds, a tuff competition to sports cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the gigantic V8 petrol engine the G63 also have few things that make life really easy like a seat massager and Active Park Assist and comfortable 7-seater. The interiors are same like the GL series, equipped with good features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all, the car is outstanding as per the power because having the capacity to pull an aircraft is something unimaginable. AMG have always satisfied us with their outstanding technology and ultimate features. And this one for sure will clear the ramp for its unmatchable performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#www.bigboytoyz.com</p>\r\n",

I opened my laptop and started watching one of the TV series I had started few weeks back &quot;Suits&quot;. Even that too was making me bored till the time I saw one of the &#39;Beast&#39;. This one was a different one we see in movies, it roared more furiously, had more strength than any other of its kind. Don&#39;t worry its not about an animal, its about a car I came across in one of the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shoppers in the market ready to invest good amount of money to get supercharged supercars obviously have high expectations. Fortunately for them, every car in this rarefied segment offers ample power, responsive handling, upscale surrounding and a unique character. But there are always those who seek a bit more - more exclusivity, more presence, more panache and more performance. For these particular kinds of buyers, the Maserati GranTurismo is, quite literally, a tailor-made solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every Maserati is like a work of art, its perfection expressing its proud history of unmistakable styling and technological innovation, enhanced by experience and expertise. The name Maserati means passion, ingenuity and the eternal quest for perfection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maserati GT succeeds in combining unrivalled class and elegance with uncompromising sports performance. Inspired with the Maserati&#39;s one of the concept cars, the exterior appears muscular, with a natural fluidity that starts at the front and extends all the way along the sides to the tail lights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beating heart of the Maserati GranTurismo is its 4.2 litre V8 engine which incorporates technical features that ensure power and speed, typically kind of racing engines from which the company has always drawn its inspiration. The car comes with a Maserati Stability Program (MSP) which is an advanced electronic system and helps the car to reduce torque and triggers the brakes to stabilize the car in just a few milliseconds in the event of skidding. The car reaches 0-60 mph in 5.2 seconds and can reach upto a top speed of 285Km/h.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maserati GranTurismo is not only best equipped but also goes about its business with an air of exclusivity that few cars at any price point can match. For discriminating and well-heeled buyers looking for something a little different, that&#39;s worth more than anything in the world.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

It should be also be strong, spacious and of course value for money. One such car I came across was Chrysler 300c. The car is unique in its own way with its 3.0 L, V6 240 bhp engine. This is a real head-turner of an executive car, just the thing for those to whom an Audi A6 or BMW 5-series will not be there choice. Underneath Chrysler 300c has a very powerful chassis generating a lot of grip and feeling less custard-like than the old car</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seriously plush ride and overall refinement are more impressive. The engine is quite swift too and the car has enough torque for easy overtaking. The car is made up of top notch materials and quality craftsmanship. It is a vehicle with RWD performance, superior handling and maximum road comfort. Chrysler has been a top pick among the full-size sedans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 300C has always been a large car and this one serves only to remind us of its ample cabin space. The car is so spacious that you can comfortably sit either rear or in the front in the car with good boot space. The dial is fantastic with 8.4 touchscreen, which masterminds audio, climate, communications and car functions.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>The Mercedes G65, S65 and the S65 Coupe models received a very huge response all across the globe, and seeing this success it is no surprise that Mercedes made a decision to plonk the AMG twin-turbocharged V-12 mill into the bonnet of the 2017 Mercedes-AMG S65 Cabriolet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes cars are simply top of the line in many aspects when compared with other German counterparts. So it is no surprise that the Cabriolet has come to be one stunning beauty from the floor of Germany&#39;s biggest car manufacturer. The stunning beauty is a four-seater convertible that has some serious power and grunt to it. Though <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a></strong> has limited the top speed to 250 kmph, still the car is capable to hit the 100 kmph mark in 4.1 seconds. This is all thanks to the V12 and the engineers at AMG. But if you thought this could be a deal breaker, then Mercedes is also offering a Mercedes-AMG Driver&#39;s Package that will increase the top speed of the car to 300 kmph. Now that sounds pretty sweet, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the hood of the car is a familiar 6 liter mill churning out 621 horses and a whopping 1000 Nm of torque, all thanks to the twin-turbocharging system. When this much of power is available, one can easy make out that the car is a very effortless one to drive around city, and when it gets a free road on the highway, it can munch miles without you even realizing. But that is not it. As much a smooth and revv happy engine it maybe, when the foot is put down, the sublime roar of the car is something that will make your heart race faster and is absolutely unmatched by any car on the road. Interestingly the car gets a rear wheel drive rather than a front which is better if we look at it that way, but one could even argue that Mercedes-AMG should have had provided a four wheel drive for this car to make it a lot more exciting. The power from the engine is transmitted to the wheels via a 7 speed automatic transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making this car was not as simple as plonking the V12 in the chassis of the previous version Cabriolet. This S-Class beauty has been built completely new using lightweight materials in the construction to make sure that the weight of the car is exactly as the same as the outgoing version and also even with the reduced weight of the chassis and body, the car gets the same amount of strength and torsional rigidity. Even the suspension on the car is an air suspension one of a basic kind but the engineers have tuned it to provide better stability and reduce body roll as much as possible. The new electrical steering also tuned for the new body and this means the driver will be in complete control of the car and the car is also now a great handling one with high response to even the slightest change in controls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the car is not loaded only on the outside, but on the inside as well. The S65 Cabriolet gets everything from the stables of Mercedes-AMG that one could imagine. There is a HUD (Heads Up Display) which displays all the key information of the vehicle such as speed, Navigation, traffic information and the important necessity. There is also a touchpad surface which acts as the input as well as multimedia hub for the car. As for the driving comfort the car gets a lot of electronic driving aids with the car along with the usual ABS and EBD. It also gets various drive modes like Regular, City, Economy, Sports, Hill Assist, etc. There is also a Driving Assistance Package including a Distronic Plus System which is a cruise control system from Mercedes. Along with it there is Steering Assist autonomous highway driving and Stop &amp; Go traffic crawling assist. There are also various warning systems, the new LED adaptable headlights and automatic braking features included in the driver&#39;s aid package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since it is a convertible, one has to mention the roof of the car as it is the most important and distinguishing feature of the car. The top is a soft top made up of three layered acoustic fabric with a Nappa leather and microfiber lining to it. The top is available in Dark Blue, Dark Red, Beige and Black colors which are made to order depending on the requirement of the customer or as to which suits the car colour the most. The entire process of the top coming on or going off takes a total of 17 seconds after the press of a button and it works up to a speed of 50 kmph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mercedes-AMG S65 Cabriolet has been unveiled in Europe and should be available in the United States soon in 2016 as it is a 2017 model. Following the United States launch, the car should be available in India as well in the second quarter of 2016 with an expected price tag of around INR 1.8 - 2 crores. This is a car that many people are waiting for and it sure is going to be a huge success just like its predecessors.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Ford is one of the oldest car firms and is known for creating history in the automotive world. Fields, the current manager of Ford says that he wishes to keep the world mobile in the years to come. Hence Ford is now looking into, car-hailing as well as self-driven or electronic cars. It envisions the shortage of oil in the next 15-20 years and thus, takes the necessary steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already taking steps towards the decided course, Ford has made an investment of around $4.5 billion in the electric vehicles market. However, the firm has received a lot of flak since they decided to expand into other markets and widen the variety of cars keeping global warming in mind. It is true that the emission units of Ford have decreased considerably in the American market but the same cannot be said for the global bazaar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, since the company is expanding in countries like China, there is every chance that the emission units are rising and not going down. However, from an objective point of view, if the plans of Ford come through, it will have succeeded in creating another revolution in the industry. Thus, even if the emission units of Ford are increasing right now, once the electric cars are on the streets and its car-hailing service is in place, the emission units will automatically go down. Hence, Ford is truly working on a futuristic vision just now. Better late than never, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of late, Ford is going to have its self-driven cars tested on the streets of California any time soon. They have enrolled for the California Autonomous Vehicle Testing program. While Ford seems to be very excited about it, California is already making laws for self-driven cars. If things go according to the plan, self-driven cars of Ford should be found on the streets of California by next year. The company seems to be very positive about this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They shall first test the sedans of their Ford Fusion Hybrids and then, move on to other cars. Automated cars are going to benefit the cities enormously. Apart from the very obvious eco-friendly benefit, they are also going to solve issues like unwanted accidents, traffic and parking space. It will also ensure that there is more space for pedestrians, cyclists and bikers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ford isn&#39;t the only one venturing into self-driven cars. Google is said to be doing it since a long time. In fact, Google also plans to start rendering the service by next year and has planned on making self-driven cars an independent firm under Alphabet Inc. Apparently Google&#39;s self-driven cars have more than 1.6 million miles on the roads of Texas and San Francisco. Hence, Google is going to be launching services in these cities. The vehicles will first be launched in college campuses, corporate parks and military bases. If they are met with success here, they will be open to general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true that all car companies are in a bid to launch self-driven vehicles first and sooner or later, this is going to become a norm. As of now, the vehicles aren&#39;t going to be available for personal use but as ride for hire services. While a lot of users are interested in making a purchase, a lot of them are apprehensive about it. The largest fear being loss of control...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research on self-driven cars is going to cost money. Google is going to showcase its Search Engine Ads on the Self-Driven Cars as well. It is also going to allow traditional automakers to use its car for car-hailing services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision to first run the car as a service is so that they can rework on any bugs in the car and keep updating the machine regularly. Once the firm feels the cars are ready for private use, they&#39;ll be let out into the market for buying. The estimated time-frame of letting these cars on to the streets is around 2 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, Ford is going to go ahead of itself and start testing its self-driven fully hybrid versions on the streets of Michigan Campus. Apart from Ford, Tesla and Cadillac are looking forward to rolling out such models too. While these cars are largely self-driven, drivers may be required to take control in certain situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understandably then, the Californian Government wants every self-driven car a steering wheel and a licensed driver behind the steering wheel. This then would defeat the very purpose of a self-driven car and Google is not to happy with the proposed law. Though the law is yet to be passed, Google is already against the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These vehicles would also be required to go through third party testing to be classified as safe. Other than that, manufacturers will be required to report the data and notify the DMV if they are collecting data beyond what is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since California is the only place in the world where self-driven cars are being tested and have a potential to run in the near future, it is also the only state to have drafted laws for self-driven cars. This means that it is creating an example of rules for the other states that are yet to see these self-driven cars on their streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question here is, is it a good precedent? Google doesn&#39;t have steering wheels or pedals on the cars that it is testing. Does this mean Google will not be able to run its cars on the streets of California? Moreover, it is not clear who exactly is the law applicable to? If the law is implied upon private car owners only, then Google may still be able to run its car hailing service. However, it may not be able to lease its cars to private companies for such services and this is one of the things that the firm was counting upon for capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, the law does come as a setback and defeats the purpose itself of self-driven cars.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<h2>Overview</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/jaguar\">Jaguar</a></strong> has been one of the brands famous for its lavish cars with tons of power, but limited in availability. There were only 2 models of Jaguar namely XF and XJ before the addition of moderately priced XE. However, it was not enough for the company to stay in hunt while other manufactures like Lamborghini, Ferrari, Lexus, Porsche, BMW, Mercedes and Audi were launching back to back sports car to hold the grip of market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then arrived the need of a sports car which not only runs and looks like a super car but holds the very effective DNA of Jaguar&#39;s handling, precision, comfort and agility and that gave the birth to all new Jaguar F-Type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car is not short of any feature than its contemporaries, its powerful hear gives the sensations of agility with utmost speed at all levels. Completing the looks are the exotic aesthetics, comfort rich interiors and a special sporty exhaust with standalone driving dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well that being said, the transmission is also a part that requires attentions for delivering wind chasing experience right from the start with a provision for dynamic launch mode. Manufactured to take the sports car world apart, Jaguar F-Type is surely an epic piece of engineering and a perfect blend of style, speed, power and comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"width: 100%;\">Let&#39;s take a virtual tour about it all around:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Supercharged Heart</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous since the dawn for its supercharged induction technology and mighty engine, Jaguar has packed F-Type with two options that gives a sense of cruising and speeding right from the moment you push the start button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These supercharged hearts carries the specs of 3.0 Litre V6 and 5.0 Litre V8 churning out power of 250Kw and 280Kw for former and 405Kw for the latter. These engines borne the legacy of Jaguar with ecstatic performance from the beginning and take the road driving experience to a whole new level.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Super Sensitive Gearbox</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cars has definitely evolved but the trend of agility, precised handling and essence of smoother power shift set by the Jaguars over the time made the developers think hard for this all new F-Type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was need of a gearbox which not only delivers power effectively but also must respond in a jiffy. And, the need has been fulfilled by ZF 8-speed automatic transmission gearbox with super sensitive response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This car part takes F-Type to 0-100 km/h in just 5.3 seconds minimum and 4.1 seconds maximum for all all-wheel drive option. Even the top speed ranges from 265 km/h to 300 km/h and it surely is top of the class, at least on Indian roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exotic Exteriors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing can beat Jaguar F-Type in terms of aesthetics if you&#39;re discussing about a coupe or a convertible. The perfectly sculptured looks developed by state-of-art engineering and Jaguar&#39;s next gen design theory, F-Type seems to have left nothing behind but itself when passed through the roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Completing the looks are sweptback bi-function HID Xenon headlamps, to die for side curves, LED headlights, panoramic roof, deployable door handles and twin exhaust. And, if you&#39;re not happy with regular aluminium glass roof, Jaguar has glass and carbon fibre roof options available right in front on you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Never Before Experienced Interior Comfort</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a British car, Jaguar has always been very classy and retro with interiors having perfect blend of modern amenities and gadgets keeping driver in focus all the time. This new F-Type is also not an exception when it comes to interiors as it has the most comfortable seat you&#39;ll get to sit along with neatly placed gadgets and retro instrument cluster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The need of personalisation has also been taken care off with many trim packs on offer as per the buyer&#39;s need and requirements. The new F-Type is also compatible with current generation media and entertainment devices available in car to keep the trip entertained enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fast Yet Safe</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every sports car maker has to keep its thinking cap on while designing a vehicle to ensure that passengers stay safe at high speeds. Well, I must say that Jaguar has left all its counterparts behind in safety with features it has made available in F-Type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting with Reverse Parking Camera and roll over protection bars behind seats, the list of safety features goes as followed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic high beam that adjusts according to the terrain and traffic with the help of a sensor mounted on the bonnet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advance pedestrian system to save them from hitting the hard points and rear traffic warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4 Airbags with intelligent seat belts tightening in case of emergency braking and emergency brakes applying force to stop the car with respect to the force applied on brake paddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart form above, the superlight aluminium structure is also tested under harshest conditions possible for crash and other mishaps, and has emerged as one of the safest ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Let&#39;s Conclude</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You could talk about Jaguar F-Type all day long and yet the features won&#39;t get complete, but the talk would surely make you fall for this sports car by lavishest of companies of current era. There&#39;s nothing you could ask more from the makers of F-Type, even the name is one of its kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power it generates, the response it gives, the agility it offers, the acceleration is produces, the top speed it cruises with, the looks it carries, the comfort it provides and the safety it ensures are comparable to to none.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the all new Jaguar F-Type is an epic saga of engineering for those who wish to talk with wind while driving with their cockpit offering them richest of features and the aesthetics making an style statement everywhere it passes from.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Lamborghini has a knack for doing things differently. While other supercar manufacturers concentrate on making their cars easier to drive and and more precise to handle, the Bologna-based Italian car maker goes about tinkering its cars in a mental and quite the unconventional way. So when we say Lamborghini does things differently, what we actually mean is that it makes its cars madder, louder, flashier and scary fast as it possibly can!</p>\r\n<p>The latest bull to come from the <strong><a href=\"/lamborghini\">Lamborghini </a></strong>stable is called the Huracan LP580-2. Yes, it's a different variant of the same old Huracan LP610-4, but it comes with some revised numeric values and pack a heck of a lot of drama! Unlike the four-wheel drive or standard Huracan LP610-4, the LP580-2 is a rear-wheel drive version of the Huracan. That means power reserves are only served to the rear wheels in the new car. What's it purpose you ask? Well, according to Lamborghini this new iteration of the Huracan is aimed at customers who \" want an even more intense driving experience, or who currently drive other rear-wheel- drive marques and aspire to driving a Lamborghini\". Get the drift?</p>\r\n<p>The regular Lamborghini Huracan is already a pretty hardcore car to drive. But then, most of the owners/cynics have complained that it is just too civil or sedate to drive. They say the Huracan doesn't have that 'typical' Lamborghini madness. As a consequence of this criticism, Lamborghini bosses have decided to shut these people's mouth; the four-wheel drive system of the regular model has been ditched in the LP580-2, making it more tail-happy and a bit of a handful to drive.</p>\r\n<p>The Huracan LP580-2 comes powered by the same mid-mounted naturally aspirated V10 powerplant as the standard car. But because the power is now only sent to the rear wheels, the engine has been detuned so as to prevent unsuspecting drivers from spinning out and crashing this more intense baby-Lambo. The V10 engine develops 580PS of maximum power output and 540Nm of peak torque in the LP580-2. The standard Huracan in comparison develops 610PS and 560Nm, but don't forget it also comes with a more secure and less dramatic four-wheel drive system.</p>\r\n<p>A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission continues to do the power transmission duties in the LP580-2. Since there's no four-wheel drive system now, the LP580-2 is also lighter by up to 33 kilograms in comparison to the standard LP610-4.</p>\r\n<p>The difference in firepower is clearly evident once you compare both the cars' performance figures. The LP580-2 will hit 0-100kmph in 3.4 seconds and continue on to its top speed of 320kmph. The LP610-4, however, does the same run in 3.2 seconds and has a higher top whack of 325kmph. But again, the whole point of developing the LP580-2 is to make it more mental and more engaging to drive. So prospective owners, or critics for that matter, should not be complaining about its performance.</p>\r\n<p>To help distinguish the LP580-2 from the regular car, Lamborghini designers have carried out some subtle design revisions in the new model. Up front, it comes with larger air intakes and a redesigned front bumper, while it also gets 19-inch Kari alloy wheels and a new rear bumper design. Even on the inside, things are more or less the same as they are in the standard model. However, you do get Lamborghini personalisation programme Ad Personam now, which is the latest Lamborghini infotainment system having a 12.3-inch high resolution TFT instrument panel.</p>\r\n<p>So, visually there aren't many changes, but a lot has been done under the skin of the LP580-2. Lamborghini has re-engineered the steering system, suspension setup, traction control systems and the power management model for the LP580-2. The weight distribution is said to have a 40:60 front to rear bias in order to reduce the axle inertia. Braking system has been enhanced with steel brakes fitted with aluminium calipers. In addition to that, the new suspension setup gets uprated springs and anti-roll bars on double wishbone suspension that enhances the torsional stiffness of the Hurac&aacute;n LP580-2 by 50% as compared to the regular model.</p>\r\n<p>Now coming to the main aspect of the Lamborghini Huracan LP580-2, its price. Lamborghini recently launched the Huracan LP580-2 in the Indian market. And it's priced at a whopping Rs 2.99 crore (ex-sh, Delhi). There's however one thing worth reminding- the LP580-2 is cheaper than the LP610-4 in our market. So, to sum it up, the LP580-2 is more mental, more engaging, more scary, more flamboyant and more affordable than its relatively sedate counterpart. A true Lamborghini in every sense then? You bet!</p>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>How do you take excellence and make it better? The new Mercedes Maybach S600 is the answer you are looking for. It is not just an extended wheelbase <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/s-class\">S-class</a> &ndash; not that there is anything wrong with the idea of an extended wheelbase S Class in itself &ndash; the Maybach S600 takes the opulent luxury to a different plane, with additional leg space and a horde of luxe touches inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Mercedes gave life again to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/maybach\">Maybach </a></strong>name in 2002, the experiment did not meet with the success it envisaged. The car was almost outdated when launched and there were not much changes till the production was pulled almost a decade after. The numbers the car did were a disappointment to put it politely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that was the story then! Taking few leaves from the history, Mercedes did the smart thing now &ndash; it created a much better car than the S class, with a whopping 8.1-inch of extra wheelbase and loaded the vehicle with unprecedented levels of luxury and equipment. The result is the <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.co.in/content/india/mpc/mpc_india_website/enng/home_mpc/passengercars/home/new_cars/models/mercedes-maybach/mercedes-maybach_s-class.flash.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes Maybach S600</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Maybach is not a supercar and it never pretends to be a driver&#39;s car, but a car in which you have to be driven in. The roles are reversed &ndash; the action happens at the rear seats and the pilot seats are for the spectators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exterior touches are subtle &ndash; there are no drastic changes and if you are not observant enough, the car can pass for a normal S class, if not for the extended wheelbase. The exterior gets loads of chrome &ndash; the front and rear bumpers are based on the normal S class but with a truck load of additional chrome. The C pillar gains a small quarter glass window and the car gets the optional 20-inch Maybach exclusive wheels that resemble a silver bowl, and imparts a certain character to otherwise what is a much understated car. The exterior also gets exclusive Maybach badges, which will help the discerning eyes to realize this vehicle is very close to heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The body is made of aluminum hybrid and the car comes with a host of assist options to help the chauffeur pilot the car around while making sure that the passenger enjoys his champagne from the bespoke Champagne Flutes. The car is equipped with magic air suspension, which uses cameras to scan the road surface and makes adjustments to the car&#39;s suspension so that the road&#39;s imperfections are fully filtered out from entering the cabin. Then there is the Distronic Plus &ndash; which is a semi-automatic cruise control that assists the steering, acceleration and braking duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The S class is already a very accomplished luxobarge &ndash; with striking exterior, pleasing interior, a plush ride and a laidback driving experience. The Maybach S600 does not improve any of these for the driver, but for the rear passengers who are actually in for a treat. Open the door and what greets you are the two mammoth seats that are not out of the place in the most expensive executive Jets. The headrests are like a pillow, and the seats are so big that they can swallow you and keep you comfortable during the journey. It goes without saying that the seats have extendable foot rests to sooth your legs during that long trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mammoth seats have multiple counters and air pockets that can be inflated to make sure that the seat counters are adjusted as per your wish. The seat also features hot stone massage, in addition to the normal seat massaging system that helps to ease you into a relaxed mood. Also, the side bolsters of the seats adjusts dynamically during the journey to make sure that you always have the lateral support and do not feel the swaying motion during the hill station trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seats also feature memory buttons that can memorize your favorite seating positions (you can store up to 3 different positions) and can recline up to 37 degrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two 10-inch individual media screens that are adjustable and come with wireless headphones along with the panoramic sunroof and ambient lighting with multiple color options to choose from, but all these get faded when compared with the luxury surrounding you in the cabin. There are acres of finest wood and miles of finest leather, encasing your senses and elevating you to a whole new level of luxury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cabin is silent (Mercedes claims this to be the most silent production saloon in the world and we don&#39;t see any doubt to question the claim), as the engine noise is never heard inside it. What you can hear is sensuous sound pouring from the bespoke Burmester surround sound system, which comes with 24 specially designed speakers paired with 24 channel amplifier. This system reproduces the mono, stereo and multi-channel sounds three dimensionally inside the cabin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The carpet is the real sheepskin and is plush enough to sink your foot. The cabin uses generous amounts of Nappa leather that is hand stitched to ensure perfection and spots bespoke wooden trim to suit your taste. For those who like to work on the move, a full length center console with deployable tables can be the option. Also on the offer are aluminum fold-out tables and a refrigerator to keep your champagne cold during the outings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes has equipped the Maybach S600 with what it calls &#39;Air Balance System&#39;, which helps to fragrance the interior according to your personal taste. This system also combines an air ionizer and an air filter. The system gently releases the choice of fragrances to the interior, while making sure that the smell doesn&#39;t lingers on to the cabin surfaces &ndash; the result is a pleasing and refreshing aroma, which vanishes quickly when the system is not working. The signature fragrance is Agarwood essence, which is provided in a signature flask with Maybach lettering. There are four more choices and the fragrances can be switched anytime by switching the flask inside the fragrance generator, situated inside the glove compartment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car has an impressive array of safety features such as PRE-SAFE that combines active systems such as sensors and assists and passive systems such as air bags and seat belts to identify critical situations and deploy counter measures and preventive steps in case of an unavoidable collision. The driver gets the Night View Assist package, which displays outlines of pedestrians and other hazards during low light and dark, on the cockpit display. The car also boasts active parking assist that helps in parking the car automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybach S600 is powered by a very sweet sounding 6L twin turbo V12 engine that churns out 523 BHP and 830 Nm of torque. The sedan is launched in India by Mercedes as a CBU. For the discriminating few who values understated elegance, space, opulence, comfort and cutting edge technology and most of all, the rear seat comfort, the ultimate choice has arrived.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>As far as the automobile industry is concerned, the year 2015 was a very interesting one. We witnessed the unveiling of many noteworthy models ranging from small to the fast to the insane, but if the trends are anything to go by, the automobile manufacturers are going to give us a lot to look forward in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the manufacturers are busy creating hybrids with a character while some are busy giving the finishing touch to their cars, which will redefine the segments &ndash; so, whatever may be your cup of tea, fret not &ndash; there is something behind the curtains, which will set your pulse racing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep you abreast of what is happening in the automobile world, we have compiled the list of top 5 cars that you should watch out in 2016. So if you plan to sign the dotted line for a new addition to your garage, do read on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jaguar F Pace</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is an award for the most creative or outlandish entry to the stage, it will go straight to the F Pace. If you haven&#39;t seen the gravity defying loop performed by the F Pace, do take a look &ndash; it is worth your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The F Pace shares its underpinnings with Jaguar XE that is giving a tough fight to the BMW 3 series, and will come with a 3.0 Liter supercharged V6 powertrain that churns out the power of 340bhp, mated to a 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will make sure that the F Pace will be dynamically an accomplished SUV and will run rigs around its competitors, setting the cash registers ring. The word in the street is that this might become the bestselling Jag in the current year, and we don&#39;t see any doubt in this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lamborghini Huracan LP610-4 Spyder</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you make your best offering better? Ask this question to Lamborghini and it will show you the Huracan LP610-4 Spyder &ndash; the Huracan without a roof. The Spyder shares the exact same engine with the coupe, the 5.2 liter V10 engine that outputs 602bhp, the same 7-speed dual clutch transmission and the same all-wheel drive system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lamborghini has worked its magic and has kept the Spyder under 3400 pounds, with the confirmation that the spyder&#39;s chassis made from carbon fiber and aluminum is 40% stiffer than the predecessor, Gallardo Spyder. The Huracan Spyder can operate the hood even at 31mph and takes just 17 seconds to fold down. It can also take you to 124mph in 10.2 seconds and can go all the way till 201mph.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Aston Martin DB11</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The world is looking forward for the DB 11 because it is just not a new model launch &ndash; this signifies the total reboot of the brand itself and is the first giant step the company takes under the leadership of Andy Palmer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DB 11 is the replacement of DB 9, and though will feature many attributes that appeals to the existing patrons, at the same time will be a brand new model with lot of modern underpinnings and techno wizardry, noticeably borrowed from Mercedes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are unconfirmed reports that the V12 engine will be turbocharged (based on the spy photos doing rounds) and will be coupled with a manual transmission. Also, the switchgear and the dials are shared with the S-class, hinting some cutting edge infotainment system, which will be a welcome change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trivia: DB 11 is the successor or DB 9, so where is DB 10? Don&#39;t rake your brains much &ndash; head over to the nearest theater which plays Spectre and you can see the DB 10 in its full glory. But don&#39;t assume that DB 10 is just a marketing gimmick &ndash; this actually serves up as a canvas of how DB 11 will turn up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rolls-Royce Dawn</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially a Wraith without head, Dawn is what <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/rolls-royce\">Rolls Royce</a></strong> claims to be the most refined convertible in the world. True to its promise, the car has more than enough space for four adults, acres of premium wood and leather and an options list that is bound only by your imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dawn shares only the doors and the bumpers with the Wraith in exterior department, while under the hood shares the same engine and drive train, which means the old faithful 6.6L V12 with 563bhp finds its place under the hood of the Dawn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car retains the rear hinged doors (also popularly known as suicide doors) and the signature retractable hood ornament and boasts gauges fashioned after wrist watches, bespoke audio system and a touch pad (because a touchscreen that will retain the fingerprints is just so horrible inside a Rolls).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convertible operation is touted as world&#39;s silent convertible; a claim which we found no qualms to accept, given the history of Rolls Royce, it has given enough structural beefing and suspension tweaks to make sure that the Dawn retains the signature Magic Carpet ride of the brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bugatti Chiron</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If numbers can create magic, then try these &ndash; 1500bhp power with over 290mph top speed and 0 to 60mph in just about 2 second &ndash; this is not some sort of sorcery, but the figures which the upcoming Bugatti Chiron boasts, and justifiably so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chiron has huge shoes to fill in as the replacement of one of the fastest automobiles ever made, and the initial reports and numbers indicate that the Chiron is up to the task and the replacement will be more explosive than the Veyron. The reports hint at a couple of electronic turbocharges in addition to a duo of conventional turbo chargers that will churn out over 1100 lb-ft torque from the 6.0 liter W12 engine. The car will have permanent all-wheel drive coupled with a 7-speed automatic gear box and will be unwrapped at the Gen&egrave;ve auto show in 2016 and we hope that Bugatti may startled us with a Chiron sized surprise and we may have something that betters all the numbers doing the rounds in the market.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>All set to bring home your dream car? Have you done enough research before even considering the car model? No? Think again! For all the road trip enthusiasts who fancy a luxury car to realize the long-pending dream trips, this article will give an extra dose of information that should be considered before stepping out for car shopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing a luxury car is not a child&#39;s play. Usually in a car, we look for comfort, appearance and prestige and just put &#39;airbags&#39; and &#39;brake system&#39; under safety requirement. However, it takes more than airbags and brake system to make a car safe. Though some of them are labeled as safer than others, which can become your ultimate travel buddy and here we are going to talk about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Qualification Criteria</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>First things first, what makes a car safe? How do we compare two cars on this criterion? The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) in America that determines and rates every new car&#39;s crashworthiness and frontal crash prevention systems does this highly critical job. Based on the performance of the cars, it releases the list of the BEST safest luxury cars in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To qualify IIHS Top Safety Pick, apart from scoring good in side, head-on and rollover tests the vehicles must achieve good ratings in the small overlap front crash test by IIHS. There are two aspects of safety: crashworthiness &ndash; how well a vehicle protects its passengers in a crash &ndash; and crash avoidance and mitigation &ndash; a technology that can prevent a collision or mitigate its gravity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Audi A6</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Performance-oriented on both city and country roads, well mannered with excellent driving dynamics, Audi A6 is the &#39;go-to&#39; car for the drivers who yearn for throughout coddling from exquisitely crafted luxury to responsive handling dynamics. It comes with the modified front end and passenger compartment to provide greater occupant protection in small overlap frontal crashes. Features like rearview camera, a 360-degree camera system, front and rear parking sensors, a head-up display, night vision assist, adaptive cruise control, active lane keep assist, blind spot monitoring and collision warning with automatic braking made A6 IIHS&#39;s favorite and garnered &quot;Good&quot; rating (the IIHS&#39;s highest ranking from among Good, Acceptable, Marginal, and Poor) in crashworthiness tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hyundai Genesis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Car that boasts a full suite of active-safety features with 5 stars from the feds and Top Safety Pick+ status from the IIHS, Hyundai Genesis is our personal favorite. In addition to the standard safety features and nine standard airbags (including driver&#39;s knee bag introduced in the 2015 model), Genesis comes with remote door unlocking, automatic crash notification, remote start, on-demand roadside assistance, stolen vehicle slowdown/immobilization, geo-fencing and recovery. An automatic emergency braking system to rule out collisions at low speed or lessen their austerity, ladders up this comfort-oriented genius to take a dig at the Big Boys.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Infiniti Q70</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Striking, voluptuous with a sharp look, Infiniti Q70&#39;s great design and intuitiveness is truly original, setting this machine apart from its competitors. This new and improved avatar of M sedan (earlier name of Infiniti Q70), has earned a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS and &#39;superior&#39; in-front crash prevention safety option.

However, it doesn&#39;t mean that other luxury cars like Mercedes S Class, Rolls Royce Phantom or Bentley aren&#39;t safe. Not all manufacturers subject their cars to the IIHS testing, so it&#39;s always better to do a thorough research before zeroing in on any car. After all, safety should always come FIRST!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Land Rover never disappoints its loyal fan-base and the new Freelander 2 is not an exception. It is everything you expect from a ROVER. It gives you -<br />1. Space<br />2. Flexibility<br />3. Capacity</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.landrover.in/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Land Rover</a> comes from the trusted brand of Jaguar and hence, one can be sure of their expectations being fulfilled.</p>\r\n<p>Rightfully then, the car is built for almost any kind of road. Irrespective of how tough the road is, the <a href=\"/land-rover/freelander\">Freelander</a> will take you through. The car has the capability to survive in the hottest temperatures and in the worst possible weather conditions. You aren't going to experience another car like this one.</p>\r\n<p>What's more! While it takes the tough road, it will ensure you have a smooth ride. Its control systems are enriching enough and will work in tandem to ensure that the passengers and the driver are a happy bunch. Formally though, it reduces engine torque by consequently improvising the traction. The force applied to the wheel is also different, owing to the reduction in torque thus, making the ride as SMOOTH as it can get.</p>\r\n<p>Nothing can get better than having a spacious car combined with good controls. The capacity of the trunk ranges from 755-litres to around 1670-litres, which means you can travel hassle-free with as much luggage as you like. Moreover, it provides the safest possible journey for one and all. It stabilizes the roll and comes with an unusually high number of airbags. No wonder, it is the most trusted car when it comes to occupant protection and road safety.</p>\r\n<p>From the green kutcha Jungles to mountainous terrains, you can take your Freelander 2 anywhere. Like a true friend, it won't betray your trust and leave you to fend for yourself. The car has been pushed to maximum limits while testing and this means that the consumer is completely free of the burden or the worry whether the car will work or not in certain conditions.</p>\r\n<p>Right from a winter that is -40 degree Celsius to a summer that goes beyond 50 degree Celsius, the Freelander has had it all. Not only these, it has also been tested at extremely high altitudes and it has worked just fine.</p>\r\n<p>It moves triumphantly like a turbine beauty clearing roads with fierce might whilst moving forward with comfortable smoothness and pace. Its arrival and departure make a casual announcement that is hard to ignore. As usual, the firm has built it using innovative technology and everyone who drives it, just can't stop singing praises of the car. As long as it's worth it, everyone is listening keenly!</p>\r\n<p>It will work wonders on the following surfaces -<br />1. Tarmac<br />2. Gravel<br />3. Sand<br />4. Snow</p>\r\n<p>Yes, you read it right! The car will show you what it's made up of on nearly every surface that exists. Be it the downward slopes of a mountain or a smooth and flat highway. Unlike other vehicles, there are system controls that help you move downwards easily without applying constant brakes. This Rover is packed with controls specifically meant for downward slopes along with a technology that automatically releases gradients that causes better fiction.</p>\r\n<p>Sadly, a lot of <a href=\"/\">luxury cars</a> don't have a lot of focus on the music. However, Freelander 2 beats them all. After all, what is the point of a luxury car without some loud and happy music?</p>\r\n<p>The music systems come from Meridian Audio Ltd., with which <strong><a href=\"/land-rover\">Land Rover</a></strong> has a tie-up. A surround sound system is fitted into the car so you can head-bang to the coolest songs while you drive.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, one might conclude that the car uses smart and modern day technology. At the same time, it doesn't lose its traditional strength whilst adhering to the generation's need for small. Yes, the car is small but not too small, thereby giving you enough space to store whatever you like.</p>\r\n<p>It catches up with the modern day consumer while keeping its style and USP intact. It is definitely one of the many historical marketing moves as not many firms get to do this. One of the obvious notable changes that the car has made to its revamped model is in the shape of headlights and backlights. The finishing of the bonnet and that of the front grill is equally enticing. It is very easy to lose yourself into the beauty and unpredictability of this car.</p>\r\n<p>Yet, with the kind of <a href=\"https://www.landrover.in/vehicles/freelander-2/specifications.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">specs</a> that the Freelander 2 comes, you'd expect nothing less! It is barely 220cms x 174cms when it comes to height and width. Moreover, you can reduce the width by 19 more centimeters by merely folding the mirrors. Thus, the car is small enough to pass through areas that are full of traffic. The luggage space is tremendous at 755-litres. You can keep anything from cycles to chairs inside the car.</p>\r\n<p>The fuel consumption level of this luxobarge is more or less economical as it consumes less than 13-litres of fuel in a kilometre. Moreover, it has a powerful TD4 engine mated to 6-speed tranny, producing a peak torque of 420Nm and maximum power of 147.51bhp that will literally make your heart go zoom as you sit behind the wheel.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to an SUV, turning it can be quite an issue but the Freelander provides you with a 2.58m torque and that too at the size of 11.3m whilst turning from one end to the other. This makes turning an extremely smooth process on city roads and even smoother on rough and rare terrains.</p>\r\n<p>When one is beating this beauty to their way with complete smoothness, it is only fair to be accompanied by a beautiful song. The Meridian Audio Systems with surround sound ensures that you enjoy great music through the woods, the mountains and the highways. After all, music has inspired quite a bunch of people to turn to the roads less travelled.</p>\r\n<p>The warmth of music will make you feel like you are a part of it. The surround sound comes with a 17-speaker arrangement and it definitely can't get better than that. It provides you with various radio options and you can also utilize the car controls to retrieve driver information from the speakers. Thus, all-in-all, Land Rover's Freelander 2 is convenient, powerful and easy to handle.</p>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Think Mercedes and the images which will flood the mind of general public will be of stately sedans and opulent luxury. Think hard and they may even think about the Sprinter, but it will be very hard to conjure the name of Mercedes with a go any were, hard hitting tough as nails SUV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But ask the people in know and they will all agree to the fact that one of the best SUVs out there, which can run rings around almost any other SUV manufactured by any other manufacturer in the planet is built by Mercedes Benz. Yes, we are talking about the Gel&auml;ndewagen or, more popularly known as <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/class/class-G/bodystyle-SUV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">G Class</a>, the granddaddy of rough and tough SUVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A legend is born:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The G class was born after a suggestion from Shah of Iran (who was a major stakeholder in Mercedes at that time) as a military oriented 4X4. Since Mercedes was a new entrant to this field, they entered into a partnership with Steyr-Daimler-Puch to develop this vehicle. This SUV was designed to be a Military and Civilian model from ground up, and the testing started at 1974. The testing happened in extreme conditions &ndash; over Sahara desert, over coal mines in in Germany and even in the Arctic Circle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official production started in 1979 and the earlier models were hand build. There was a short wheel base model and a long wheel base model on offer, with two door convertible and two door wagon (for SWB models) and four door wagon for LWB models. There was also a model without the rear windows, much like a panel van. Model numbers W460 were used to designate the civilian versions while W461 was used to designate the military and other non-civilian versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G Class was an instant success with the military, and it served as a platform for lot of modifications like fire truck, ambulance etc. Part of this success came from the fact that the SUV had a tough as nails ladder on frame chassis and three fully locking differentials, paired with bullet proof Mercedes engines. But the civilian version did not meet with instant acceptability due to the fact that the interiors were Spartan in nature and the price point at which the SUV was released pegged it as a luxury go anywhere SUV. 1981 saw first major update and Mercedes loaded the SUV with an automatic tranny, air conditioning, auxiliary fuel tank etc. along with bits and pieces from its upmarket sedans and external embellishments like headlight grills. This was followed soon by more comfortable front seats borrowed from the sedans and year by year, bit and pieces were added like electric heating, power windows, wider tyres, power antennas etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first image boost of G class happened in 1983 were it went on to win the most grueling rally in the work &ndash; the famed Dakar Rally. This made many people sit up and take notice of the offering from Mercedes and worked as a sales booster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To celebrate the first anniversary of G class, Mercedes upgraded the G class with all-time 4 wheel drive, ABS and electronic locking differentials in 1989. The interiors were spruced up with wooden trims, a much refined center console and optional leather upholstery. The chassis was also upgraded and was named W463.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 1993 saw the introduction of the first real luxury G class &ndash; the 500 GE, powered by a monstrous V8 engine, and finished with real walnut wood and leather interior. Initially, this was produced as a limited run of 500 models, and in many ways, paved way for the future G class. In 1994, this was renamed to G500, following the revamp of naming conventions across the Mercedes range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next major update in the lifecycle happened in 1997-1998 period. The chassis was upgraded, and a host of new power plants were introduced by Mercedes during this period. They also introduced a convertible model with powered top. This year also saw the return of the mighty G 500. Till the year 2003, periodic updates kept rolling in. There were improvements like multifunction steering wheels, a MID with a trip computer etc. and in the year 2002, the G class was officially introduced in USA. Though there was a loyal fan following, the one common grouse about the G class was the lack of power. At last, in 2003, Mercedes decided to fix this for once and all, and handed over the G class to their in house turning arm &ndash; the AMG. This was a pivotal moment in the history of G class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mad hatters at AMG extracted about 57 more BHP and 51 69 Nm of torque from the V8, pushing the total output to 354 bhp. The model was called G55 AMG, and came with 18 inch wheels and featured visual tweaks such as aluminum brush guard and exhaust vents which exited from side. This was further enhanced by the introduction of the first supercharged G55 model with a 5.4 liter V8 engine block churning out 476 bhp. This was the first model which could do 0 to 60 under 5.5 seconds, an astounding feat for such a SUV. This was later followed up by a more powerful tune, delivering 493 bhp, in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007 and 2008, Mercedes introduced two facelifts &ndash; the first was comparatively minor in nature. The models gained LED tail lamps, revamped interiors with a new instrument cluster and center console and additions such as entertainment system with radio and CD player and an in dash six CD changer (DVD changer for G500), navigation, rear view camera, TPMS, power outlet etc. Also on offer was an optional Harman Kardon surround system with high performance speakers all around and an optional TV tuner. In 2009, Mercedes further added creature comfort options such as climatised and multi-counter seats, ambient lighting, and dashboard wrapped in leather, aux-in in the glove box etc. This year also saw the introduction of iPod and USB support and some new body color choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last major upgrade was received in 2012, with LED DRLs and turn indicator integrated mirrors but the majority of the changes happened under the hood and inside the cabin. The interior gained a new multifunction screen in color, new COMMAND screen, and restyled center console and dashboard. The model was also equipped with the latest DISTRONIC cruise control, PARKTRONIC park assist, Blind spot assist, MBrace2 telematics and an updated stability program. The AMG versions were updated to G63 and G65 with a 5.5 liter twin turbo V8 and 6.0 liter twin turbo V8, outputting 563 bhp and 621 bhp respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G class is the longest in production Mercedes ever (if we discount the Unimog) and from 1979, the body shape have never seen any drastic changes. The car always remained true to its roots and despite having plans to pull the plug of the production, Mercedes never came across to do it ever because of the ever increasing popularity and fan base of this SUV. The car remained loyal to the fan base by keeping the iconic body style and by never diluting the off road prowess and by adding bits and pieces to the firework by the way of AMG firepower under the hood and the finest of luxury from the stables of Mercedes inside the cabin. If you compare the car with the top of the line offerings from other manufactures, the G class may not do well, but it doesn&#39;t matter &ndash; for, G class is not just another run of the mill SUV. This is an icon, a piece of history, much like the Land Rover or the Jeep, but with a fine balance of hand built luxury and tough as nails reliability. And that makes the G class very special, for the people who lust one.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>&quot;Bentley Bentayga is an SUV with a bit of an identity crisis but in a good way.&quot; If one has to describe the Bentley Bentayga, this is what surely will come to his/her mind. Make no mistake; this is a proper SUV, but also the ultimate word in off-the-road luxury, and at the same time one of the fastest sprinting SUVs in the world. Now, if this list is not inducing identity crisis, then it is the right time to define it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Brief History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what made <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley\">Bentley </a></strong>a household name in luxury car markets? Sit up and notice the SUV landscape. Moreover, what prompted Bentley to enter the uncharted waters with a new product that disrupts its traditional sedan image? Well, for starters, the SUV market is heating up all around the world and people are buying more expensive SUVs now than before. Those who have one or two Bentleys in their garage do have more than a few cars in their fleet and invariably, some of them are SUVs. Now, if Bentley can sway them with an offering that is capable off the road, and personifies luxury inside, it is no brainer that many of these owners will switch their loyalties and will plonk their money to get the ultimate Bentley experience off the road. This will be a shot in the arms for Bentley and the company is hoping to have an almost <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">50% increase in total sales numbers</span> with the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/bentayga/bentayga.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bentayga</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Closer Look</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When Bentley decided to go ahead with the production of the EXP-9 F, showcased in 2012 <strong>Geneva Auto Show</strong>, it pulled all stops and explored many avenues hitherto uncharted &ndash; the result is nothing short of a stunning and the most advanced car ever produced by the house, which joins the powerful <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley/continental\">Continental range</a> by Bentley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While many may argue that the looks are polarizing, one thing is clear &ndash; this SUV is unmistakably a true Bentley in <a href=\"https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/bentayga/bentayga/gallery.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">looks</a>. The characteristic big diamond grill, the high waistline, the headlights &ndash; all of these proclaim the lineage from afar. There will be no mistaking this car as something else, and that is something the uber rich will really appreciate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exterior is made of aluminum and high-strength steel and have used superforming techniques to create some of the characteristic powerlines. Bentayga also enjoys <strong>fully adaptive LED lamps</strong> with integrated washers and optional 22-inch fully forged and machined aluminum wheels &ndash; the largest you can see on a production model from Bentley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step inside and the interior is nothing short of the lap of luxury. As expected from Bentley, the interior is FULLY HAND CRAFTED, and Bentley has not spared any efforts to lavish the cockpit with the finest of materials. There are acers of ultra-high quality wood, leather and turned aluminum. The seats are quilted and have the traditional British compact squares and boasts fine tailoring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior layout resembles the Bentley double wings. The electronic gear selector replaces the good old gear lever, which frees up a lot of interior space used for additional switches and continence features. The steering wheels gets paddle shifters that rotate with the steering and the cockpit display is part analogue and part digital &ndash; there is a neat digital display flanked by the two analogue dials. The <a href=\"https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/bentayga/bentayga/model-features/technology.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">infotainment system</a> is partly touchscreen and partly controlled by dial, and is very innovative and easy to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected from Bentley, the car comes with an endless list of personalization options. There are 17 standard paint shades and 90 extended shades to choose from, and if nothing in this 100 plus list suits your taste, you can make use of the bespoke color matching service to get your desired shade. The interiors are not left out either &ndash; you can choose from seven veneers and fifteen interior leather color choices, but again, the choices are not limited and if you need a particular color, all you need to do is just ask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bentayga comes loaded with the famed <strong>Mulliner driving specification</strong> from the factory, which has the signature sport pedals, quilting on door pads and seats, a jewel filler cap with an event seat tucked in the boot. This can be used either as a platform to sit or to have a grandstand view of what is happening around you or as a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">luggage divider</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the hood, lies the behemoth of a 6L 12-cylinder engine that churns out a shattering power of 600BHP and 900 Nm of torque, which helps in propelling the 2.6-ton SUV from 0-60mph in just 4 seconds and to a top speed of 187mph. This is the top-of-the-line petrol engine, and is the only option available now. Two new powertrains -a diesel and a hybrid will follow the lines in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUV</a> comes with as much as 8-drive modes (divided equally for on the road and off the road) and has a special mix and match mode, if you ever feel the need for it. Bentayga also comes with the &#39;Bentley Dynamic Ride&#39;, that are active anti-roll bars, run by electronics instead of hydraulics, which significantly reduces the reaction times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bentayga floats on air suspensions all around that isolates you from the undulations and provide that magic carpet ride quality, on or off the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SUV boats a host of features &ndash; Adaptive Cruise Control, Stop &amp; Go, Dynamic distance Monitor, etc. and has a host of Assist features such as Lane Assist, corner Speed Assist, Traffic Assist, etc. Bentley has equipped Bentayga with what it calls <strong>Intersection Assist</strong> that is a system designed to intervene if there is a chance for a frontal collision, and is designed to bring the SUV to an emergency STOP, if requires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than these, the SUV also comes with night vision, heads up display and an impressive rear entertainment system that boasts a pair of 10.2-inch removable tablets. All these gadgetry and wizardry translates into an SUV that is impressive to drive on and off the road, and the systems work so flawlessly that the SUV totally isolates the occupants from the tumbles and tribulations the road throws up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bentayga sits at the apex of the SUV pyramid now and offers the uber rich a plausible and more exclusive choice than the heavenly kitted Range Rovers and let us face it &ndash; there is no other car that blends the on and off the road performance with luxury and speed like Bentayga does. So, is it the ultimate luxury the money can buy? The apt answer is YES! At least by the time Rolls Royce brings its SUV to the party. And oh, don&#39;t forget the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Urus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lamborghini Urus</a> &ndash; the supercar SUV.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>The very mention of &#39;luxury cars&#39; immediately brings to mind a few names &ndash; Mercedes-Benz, BMW and the Audi. The mere mention of these names is sufficient to make a car lover drool at the thought of at least driving one, if not actually owning one. Of these, <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Audi</a> provides a good introduction to the world of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">luxury cars</a>. Some entry level Audi&#39;s are sufficiently affordable, that today&#39;s upcoming executives and business people can certainly consider owning one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us start with Audi A6, which an upper middle-class family could stretch themselves to own, and which is still clearly a car in the LUXURY segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Audi A6 has been around for a little over 20 years. That is not to say it is an old model. It has not always been called the A6, and has gone through several &#39;avatars&#39; so to speak. It is somewhere in the middle of the Audi stable, which has been immensely popular all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The A6 fits into the sports sedan category of a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&#39;mid-size luxury car&#39;</span>. It is a dependable workhorse but is also relatively sporty in terms of power. It has earned a name for itself by winning several <strong>awards</strong>, many of them several times. It has been a favorite rally car, topping the list of several industry ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Audi A6 is available in several variants. Essentially, the different variants sport engines of differing power. You can get A6 with either a petrol engine or a diesel one. The engine capacity could range from slightly under 2.0 liters to over 3.0 liters. In terms of transmission, several options are available &ndash; right from 6-speed manual to 8-speed automatic, to continuously variable transmission. However, all options may not be available in every model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every part and feature of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/a6\">Audi A6</a> spells luxury, of course, as compared to an ordinary car. There are far more luxurious AUDIs available, as we will soon see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it is called &#39;mid-size&#39;, on the roads it looks big in comparison to most other cars. Correspondingly, it sports a roomy interior. The rear compartment can accommodate 3 passengers comfortably, who can sit without rubbing elbows with the neighbor. In terms of legroom space, the A6 lives up to its promise of luxury. The Audi A6 passengers can stretch their legs in comfort. The luxobarge is available in several eye-catching colors. The effect of which is achieved by 4-coats of paint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard headlights use modern LED technology and produce lighting which is helpful to both &ndash; the driver and the oncoming vehicles. These headlights consume less power and are long-lasting. Optionally Audi A6 also offers <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Matrix LED headlights</span> that are controlled by an intelligent lighting system. This enables control of individual components of the LED lights. The light distribution system ensures that the headlights do not dazzle the oncoming vehicles by throwing their full force in front. The light thrown from the sedan is distributed around the oncoming vehicles, making navigation easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rear LED lights, the indicator lights, and the interior lights are too in sync with the headlight systems. The indicators produce an intelligent pattern that clearly indicates the way the car is turning. The interior lighting goes to enhance the ambiance and assists the passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The front seats are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">electrically adjustable</span>. The driver&#39;s seat can be adjusted for height and reach. In fact, even the headrests are electrically adjustable. These adjustments are memorized, so that you do not spend time adjusting them again and again. There is an armrest in the centre of the front seat, which is foldable and also has a roomy storage space. The rear seat can be fully or partially folded, to provide more <strong>ROOM</strong> in the rear luggage storage compartment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car comes with the option of either a turbocharged <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in/models/a6/A6_Saloon/technical_data/engines_and_transmissions/engines/tdi_.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TDI</a> <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in/models/a6/A6_Saloon/technical_data/engines_and_transmissions/engines/tdi_.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">engine</a> or a TFSI engine. The TFSI engine in particular &ndash; turbo fuel stratified injection &ndash; promotes higher power, better fuel efficiency and less fuel emissions. These engines can produce as much as 15% more power than their pioneers. These engines might have a lesser cubic capacity, but that makes for an engine that is lighter in weight and smaller in size. This does not mean, in any way, that the engine is less powerful or less dynamic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audi A6 uses the adaptive drive technology that adjusts the driving characteristics of the car at the touch of a button, so that when you drive, it can provide a more balanced and comfortable ride while your teenage son can adjust it to be sportier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dashboard of this powerful beast is enough to make any geek drool. A6 sports Audi&#39;s MMI or multi-media interface, which provides a touch controlled navigation panel. The MMI is integrated with 3D maps that make going to new places a breeze. Your phone can be connected to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">MMI</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">via</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Bluetooth</span> so that communicating on the move is child&#39;s play. You can make or receive calls or receive calls from the MMI. You can store your contacts on the MMI, and call them with a mere touch, or you can key in new numbers on the touch-pad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Audi A6 comes with manually adjusted sun-blinds for the rear door windows, whereas for the rear windscreen, the blinds are electrically adjustable. The air-conditioning in the vehicle can be adjusted individually for each half of the front and rear compartments, providing a high degree of personalized comfort for each occupant of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The A6 gives you all you may want in the area of entertainment &ndash; a radio, a CD player, provision for 2 memory cards, ability to play directly from the memory cards and so on. The rear seats are also pre-wired to accommodate additional entertainment equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of safety, the luxurious sedan leaves nothing to be desired. It has front and rear airbags and also side air-bags to avoid any injury. The Audi A6 sports an electronically controlled air-suspension system that automatically adjusts the vehicle height. This makes for a smoother ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps, one could go on and on about the features of the A6, as those who have driven this killer beauty know that there is no end its praise story. The introduction to Audi A6 will surely have kindled your desire to be its proud owner. Why not take the next step, and call a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/contact\">dealer</a> for a test drive today?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>If you ever ask what is the definite off roader to 100 people across the globe, at least 80 of them will pick the Land Rover Defender. Such is the charm of the rustic, bare bones but ultra-capable offering from Land Rover. But the production of this legend is nearing its end &ndash; the company is ceasing the production by December 2015 &ndash; January 2016 period. According to the latest news by <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/article/20151206/OEM04/312079985/storied-defender-due-for-new-era-rewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Autonews</a>, the successor of the legend will make the debut in 2018 and could be offered in 5 body styles with 5 different engine choices and 2 transmissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A brief history</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduced to the British motoring world in 1983, the <a href=\"https://www.landrover.com/vehicles/defender/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Defender</a> has proved its mettle in some of the world&#39;s toughest arenas and has been the choice of vehicle for almost all of the expeditions into wilderness. It is the first production vehicle to travel 18,000 miles from England to Singapore, and has been the choice of artic expeditions. Apparently, the 2.25 L engine that came in<a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/land-rover\"> Land Rover</a> does not really need a snorkel &ndash; it is so rugged that it runs even in full of water. The production of the Defender started as Land Rover One Ten and was followed by Land Rover Ninety in 1984. In 1989, the name Defender was formally introduced and from 1991, the Ninety and the One Ten models were renamed as the &quot;Defender 90&quot; and &quot;Defender 110&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design of the Land Rover Defender was largely unchanged from the original boxy shape of mechanically bullet proof Land Rover series and has the reputation of being one of the most capable off roader in the world, much like the G-Class from Mercedes Benz. It was one of the most versatile off roaders we have seen so far. There were Land Rover tanks, Land Rover trains, and even conveyor belts made by Land Rover, which the Indian Army brought in thousands and were also used by everyone, right from the medical corps to the SAS.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Cult</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Often described as the ultimate off roader, the Defender had a loyal fan base, ranging from the blue collar factory worker to the British Royal Family. The list of famous owners includes famous personalities like Kevin Costner, Sylvester Stallone, Bill Murray, Brayan Adams, Ralph Lauren, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, Jane Fonda and Paul McArtney to name a few. The Defender has starred in numerous movies (remember the tough-as-nails Defender in Lara Croft &ndash; Tomb Raider or the epic stunt by Richard Hammond where he scales a dam with the Defender, recreating an advert from the 1980s) including the recent James Bond flick &ndash; Spectre. The Demise</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though unparalleled in many ways, the company had to stop the production of the Defender since the EU authorities have marked the legendary SUV for failing to meet the emission, pedestrian safety and crash standards. To pay its respect to the legend, Land Rover drew a giant outline of the SUV of about 1KM in the sand at Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey (Wales), where Maurice &amp; Spencer Wilks first drew the sketch of the model in 1947. Six Defenders drew the outline with 12-foot farming tills attached to them. Six legendary models comprising of Land Rover &ndash; Series I, II and III, Land rover Ninety, a Defender 90 Hard Top and a Defender 110 Station Wagon came together at the beach to complete this homage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Resurrection</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the curtain is slowly closing down (the company is planning to end the production in Dec 2015 &ndash; Jan 2016 Period), all is not lost. The company has plans to introduce a successor but with a time gap of about 2 to 3 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the original Defender was targeted at the farmers, Authorities, Militaries and though it gained a wide access to the discerning gentleman garage due to its rugged charm, the company has to reposition the new model to make sure that the model is a commercial success. The new model will have to target consumers at two ends of a spectrum &ndash; the hard core off roaders as well as the fashion conscious urban dwellers who fancy themselves as off road enthusiasts, so it is not an easy task to redesign the legend. The design has to be a fine balance between hardy and approachable, so that it don&#39;t lose the acceptance with the hard core off road enthusiast, but at the same time, gain acceptance to the garage of the city warrior who fancies a trip or two to the grasslands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to few unconfirmed reports, the new Defender will ride on a new platform called &quot;D7u&quot;, which is a derivative of Land Rover&#39;s PLA unibody structure &ndash; so, while it is a departure from the traditional ladder on frame structure of current Defender, it will offer more comfort, safety and modularity in comparison to the original one. This is the same structure that is used by larger Range Rover SUVs, and will still have crucial features like low range transfer case with two differential locks, live axle setup, etc. for superior off road performance. Rumor is also that the new model will have as many as five different body styles &ndash; ranging from a tough and no frills short wheel base model to a long wheel base luxury off roader, and will have an open top and a pick up in the lineup. If the inside talks are any indication to go by, the recently launched limited edition Heritage, Adventure and Autobiography editions of the Defender can be seen as a baby step towards this differentiation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These models will be powered by engines from the Jaguar Land Rover&#39;s new engine series called Ingenium. The family contains a total of five models &ndash; two 2-liter diesel engines with four-cylinders churning out the maximum power of 150bhp and 180bhp, two 2-liter petrol engines with four-cylinders producing a maximum power of 180bhp and 240bhp and a 3.0-liter V6 engine topping a power of 300bhp. The transmissions on offer will be a six-speed manual and a nine-speed automatic gearbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Defender&#39;s off-road ability will be surely appreciated by the puritans, the new users will be interested by the huge improvements in comfort, ergonomics, safety, efficiency and ride and handling. One of the major challenges the designers and the bean counters will face is to make the production run profitable and to help this, the Defender will not have costly additions like air suspension or an active body control, but however, a dedicated Terrain Response System and an up-to-date infotainment system will most probably make its way to the features list. The assisting features like hill ascend control, hill descended control, navigation with emphasis on off-the-road performance will also be a part of the list of equipment available, though we have to wait and see what all make it as a part of the standard equipment list. The predicted sale is about 30,000 units per year globally, and while this is not a huge number, this sure is a huge step forward and the production can be scaled up to meet the demand, if the demand is more than the predicted supply. It is sure that the new Defender will surpass the current model by a huge margin when it comes to mass appeal, ability, safety and price, but will face stiff competition from the new Mercedes Benz G Class and Jeep Wrangler &ndash; another two iconic off roaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new design will have to be equally good for the guy in his Harris Tweed jacket as well as for the British Royal Family and the whole world is waiting with bated breath to see how Land Rover delivers it.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>In another signature move, the Indian Automobile major, Mahindra and Mahindra, has brought Pininfarina to its fold for $28 million. The rumor mills were busy about the buyout, but it took more than few months for the acquisition to bear fruits. The total value of this deal is more than $125 million (Mahindra will pay around $28 million for 76-percent, and will make offers for the remaining 24 percent). In addition to the cash payout, Mahindra has guaranteed the Italian design house&#39;s creditors more than $125 million and promises to invest a further $20-plus million into the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mahindra.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mahindra</a> has assured that there will be no change in the design house&#39;s long standing agreement with other auto makers, and there are no plans to relocate the company to India. <a href=\"https://www.pininfarina.com/en/homepage/homepage.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pininfarina</a> will continue to remain an independent company, and will continue to be listed on the Milan Stock Exchange and Mr. Paolo Pininfarina will continue as the Chairman of its board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The legendary high-end design credentials of Pininfarina will significantly enhance the design capabilities of the entire Mahindra Group. Given the increasing design sensibilities of today&#39;s consumers, product design will greatly influence customer choice and experience, and hence our success,&quot; said Anand Mahindra, Chairman of the Mahindra Group, in the press statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pininfarina is credited with shaping the entire <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferraris</a> from mid-1950 to LaFerrari, but of late, it is not so profitable due to the less prominent roles design houses play since most of the companies rely on in-house talent than opting for design houses for the new models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.techmahindra.com/media/press_releases/Pininfarina-becomes-the-latest-jewel-in-TechMahindra-crown.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">sources</a>, while there will be no changes to the way Pininfarina operates, what Mahindra is looking for will be to have design inputs for its home grown brand as well as the acquired brand &ndash; SsangYong. SsangYong has often been criticized for the looks and that will be one front Mahindra will leverage the power gained by this acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History of the House of Pininfarina</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Pininfarina was founded by Battista &quot;Pinin&quot; Farina in 1930 at Cambiano, Italy. The company started its life as a coach builder and built bodies for Rolls Royce, Hispano Suiza, Alfa Romeo, Isotta-Fraschini, etc. By 1950, Pininfarina started designing Ferrari&#39;s and soon they became inseparable. Pininfarina has created countless masterpieces such as 250 GT, Daytona, Cisitalia 202, etc. Alfa Romeo followed Ferrari and entered into a partnership with Pininfarina. By this time, Pininfarina had invested heavily into automobile body production, research and development, manufacturing techniques, etc. It is a fact that the company had one of the first full sized wind tunnels for automotive research, back in 1972. The <strong>Alfa Giulietta Spider</strong> was the first mass produced car by Pininfarina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first foray of this Italian car designer to US was with Nash cars, and Nash heavily leveraged its connection with Pininfarina even though most of the Nash models were reworked to suit American tastes. Though the campaign did not yield the desired results for The Nash, the campaign made Pininfarina a household name in US by mid 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pininfarina has not only designed cars for Ferrari, Maserati, Alfa Romeo, Rolls Royce, Lancia, Cadillac, etc. but has also designed rolling stocks, automated light rail cars, bullet trains, buses, trams, people movers, yachts, airplanes, and private jets and also provided consultation on industrial and interior design, architecture, and graphic design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Why and How of the Marriage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mahindra is a conglomerate and operates companies in multiple sectors such as Aerospace and defense, automobiles, motorcycles and scooters, automotive aftermarket, farming equipment, financial services, hospitality, business partnerships, real estate and information technology. The Pininfarina acquisition is under a joint venture comprised of the parent company Mahindra Group, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra (the automotive arm), and Tech Mahindra (the IT arm).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, Pininfarina has modeled almost 1000 cars and has become the synonym for jaw droopingly beautiful Italian supercar designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From an outset, the two companies do not share a lot of common ground, so it is natural for many to feel perplexed by this acquisition. But if one dives a bit deep, this makes perfect sense since it is no secret that Mahindra is eyeing the US market and is trying to get a foot hold there. The acquisition of SsangYong was a first step in this direction, but unfortunately, SsangYong have next to zero value in US, so while the acquisition worked in India, it did not bode well for the US dreams of Mahindra. What Mahindra needed was a name that has a pedigree and lineage and a name recognition, and Pininfarina has them in truckloads. Now with Pininfarina under its wings, Mahindra is in a unique position to enter the niche market with a clean slate, which if the rumors are anything to go by, will happen sooner than later. &quot;Our clients want more from us, consistently. Adding Pininfarina&#39;s legendary design skills to our Integrated Engineering Solutions enables a strong entry into Automotive styling, design &amp; development and reinforces our body engineering capabilities. Further, Pininfarina&#39;s 25-year design expertise in industries beyond Automotive will give us that winning edge in areas such as Aerospace, Consumer Electronics, Architecture &amp; Interiors and Transportation where we already have a strong footprint,&quot; according to CP Gurnani, CEO &amp; Managing Director, Tech Mahindra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paolo Pininfarina, Chairman Pininfarina S.p.A. added, &quot;In a globalized world, entrepreneurship and capital do not need a passport. We are joining hands with a $3.9 Billion Technology &amp; Global partner, and part of the $16.9 billion global Mahindra Group, which will not only strengthen our Italian identity but will open more doors. Tech Mahindra&#39;s global presence and global delivery model will allow us to compete for a larger pie of the business.&quot;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>It is not given to every concept to successfully transform from concept to a complete product that WOWS. But <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/i/i8/2014/showroom/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BMW i8</a> made its way out! It was one of the <strong>Vision Efficient Dynamics system cars</strong> and was first showcased in the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A production version was first launched in 2014, and the Indian model was launched in February 2015. It is a sports hybrid and is indeed a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">luxury car</a> to dream or even drool about. The i8 has been built with super high performance as its core theme. As if building on ideas from the James Bond, Star Wars, or maybe even Harry Potter series, the i8 manages to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">extract 47.5 kilometers</span> from a liter of petrol. Of course, the reason behind this is the amalgamation of technologies, backed by 2 power sources. The first is a lithium-ion battery-powered electric motor that produces a power of 131PS and powers the front wheels. The second is a 1499 cc 3-cylinder petrol engine, producing power of 231PS energizing the rear wheels. Together they provide <strong>362PS power!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The electric motor is charged on the go when the petrol engine is in use. Otherwise, it can be charged within 3 hours, from a normal electrical outlet. The electric motor has <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">a range of 35kms</span> and a maximum speed of 120km/h. With power from both the electric motor and the petrol engine, the i8 can reach the speed of up to 250km/h.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that, of course, is under the hood, so to speak. Externally, every line and every curve in the i8 is designed to make it run more smoothly, as if simply gliding through the air. The i8 is a marvel of applied AERODYNAMICS. The car is a mix of lightweight materials that aid in gaining speed, and keeping the ride smooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hybrid sports a very sporty look, like any other <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">modern BMW</a>. It has the signature kidney grill and u-shaped LED headlights. At the rear, the roof meets the sweeping rear LED lights, merging into a rear spoiler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is loaded with <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/i/i8/2014/showroom/safety.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">safety features</a> &ndash; airbags, ABS, dynamic braking stability and a host of others. The petrol engine and the electric motor are placed as low as possible, greatly improving the center-of-gravity of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internally also, the i8 is fully loaded with excellent features. It has got an all-digital instrument cluster. Its steering wheel incorporates the multimedia controls and the cruise control. It has got the <strong>BMW Professional navigation system,</strong> backed by <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Big+Boy+Toyz/@28.433953,76.9973973,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x390d17e8bfffffff:0xdb108da17afb495b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google maps</a>. It has got an excellent sound system with great speakers. Front and rear parking cameras are standard. Likewise, Bluetooth and USB connectivity is also supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, the BMW i8 is a model to emulate, a wonder that what engineering and technology can produce. It is a perfect blend of <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/i/i8/2014/showroom/efficiency_dynamics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">power and performance</a> while paying attention to environmental concerns.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>There are 4X4 off roaders and then there are 4X4 off roaders &ndash; and standing tall among the most capable off roaders out there is the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/toyota/land-cruiser\">Toyota Land Cruiser</a>. The EPITOME of reliability and go anywhere prowess, the Land Cruiser has a fan following from the Australian outback to the primeval jungles of Tanzania. Over the years, Toyota have kitted the Land Cruiser with bits and pieces of luxury to transform it from a hard <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">core SUV to a luxury off roader</span>, with the remarkable feat of not losing any of its famous off road capability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the year 2016, Toyota has done another facelift to make sure that the Land Cruiser remains in the shortlist of those who are shopping for their dose of luxury SUV. The exterior redesigned the Land Cruiser to a more <strong>purposeful look</strong> &ndash; on the road and off the road. The Bonnet line is new and so are the bumpers. The SUV gets a redesigned front grill, which extents all the way to headlights and cleverly hides some techno wizardry like multi-terrain monitors that come to aid during off the road trips. The SUV also features Dual LED projector lamps and LED fog lamps and comes kitted with side moldings finished in chrome and embellished with LAND CRUISER LOGO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toyota does not believe in dividing the Land Cruiser in different levels, and so the SUV is available in only one, but fully loaded trim &ndash; the <a href=\"https://www.toyotabharat.com/showroom/land-cruiser-200/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Land Cruiser 200</a>. Toyota has spared no effort in filling up the SUV to the brim with almost anything available in the warehouse &ndash; be it tech, comfort or assist features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Land Cruiser can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">seat eight adults in comfort</span> on the new ventilated and heated seats (available in first and second row), clad in leather. The interior features an all new redesigned dashboard dominated by a large touchscreen display. The SUV also gets four-zone automatic climate control, which boasts 28 vents for fine controlling of the temperature inside the cabin. The rear seat passengers have a <strong>dedicated DVD entertainment system</strong> with two 11.6-inch screens to keep them occupied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third row features fold away seats that feature 50-50 split and fold away to create a flat loading surface. The second row features 40-20-40 split and gives a lot of options to carry unique shaped cargos. Toyota has given low mounted anchors and tether anchors on second row seats for added safety to the children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cabin gets LED cabin lights and comfort features such as a powered moonroof and a cooler box in the central console.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.toyota.com/entune/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Toyota Entune head unit</a> that comes in Land Cruiser is now paired with 14 JBL speakers and JBL Synthesis Audio to give that flawless audio performance, and comes with an 8-inch subwoofer and a dedicated 605 watts amplifier. This head unit also pairs with your smartphone using the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tweddle.toyota.entune&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Entune App</a>, and gives a plethora of information at your fingertips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toyota has introduced <a href=\"https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/siri_eyes_free.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SIRI Eyes Free</a> tech that helps you to speak to SIRI with the help of the push of a button, and helps you to keep your eyes on the road. A Qi wireless charging is also bundled with the SUV to make the charging of your smartphone easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MID is customizable and can show the efficiency, individual tyre pressure, navigation prompts, etc, and can even be paired with your smartphone to display the text messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SUV comes with all-time four wheel drive, and is equipped with a central locking <strong>TORSEN</strong> limited slip differential. The approach and departure angles are an impressive 30 degree and 20 degree each, a testimony to the no compromise off road attitude. To aid you during the off the road trips, the SUV comes with a multi-terrain monitor that gives you 360 degree visibility by displaying your surroundings on the navigation screen, with the help of front, rear and side cameras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toyota has added Multi-terrain select, Active Traction control and CRAWL control to aid off-the-road excursions. The Multi-Terrain select works with the low range and two speed transfer case, to help the SUV to alter and optimize the driving strategy according to the terrain and helps in minimizing wheel spins and wheel lock-ups. The <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">active traction control</span> manages the wheel spins by modulating brake and throttle controls. The CRAWL control modulates the brake and throttle inputs automatically on five low speed settings so that you can concentrate on the terrain, without being concerned about giving the right throttle inputs to tide over the rough patches. The Land Cruiser also has hill start assist and downhill assist, to help during those tricky ascends and descends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Land Cruiser is loaded with active safety suite called <strong>Toyota Safety</strong> P (TSS-P) and boasts Pre collision system with <strong>pedestrian detection</strong>, lane departure alerts, dynamic radar cruise control, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The semi-autonomous pre collision system scans the surroundings for potential hazards including pedestrians, and issues a warning if a potential impact is detected. It can also apply the brakes if the driver fails to respond to the warnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lane departure alerts make use of an onboard camera and the lane marking on the road to determine if the SUV is moving from the current lane, and will alert the driver by audio visual prompts so that the driver can take corrective actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dynamic cruise control uses radar to detect other vehicles and their speed and can actively adjust the cruising speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SUV also has safety systems like 10 airbags, vehicle stability control, multi terrain ABS with EBD and active front headrests that reposition the front headrests to help minimize the impact on the head of the passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than these, the CRUISER is also loaded with auto high beam that detects the oncoming vehicles and automatically switches the high beam on and off, smart keyless entry, HomeLink universal garage door opener and auto dimming rearview and sideview mirrors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of <a href=\"https://www.toyota.com/landcruiser/features/mechanical_performance/6156\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">specs</a>, the SUV is powered by a rugged <strong>5.7-liter V8 engine</strong>, coupled with an 8 speed automatic transmission, churning out 381hp and 401 pound feet of power and torque, respectively, and is loaded with technologies such as intelligent variable valve timing (VVT-i) and Acoustic Control Induction System (ACIS). This transmission is equipped to adjust the shifting logic, depending on the parameters such as throttle input, incline, vehicle speed, etc. to maximize the efficiency and power output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True to its off road heritage, Toyota Land Cruiser is built on a 10 member high tensile steel ladder frame and features independent double wishbone suspension with coil springs and stabilizer bar at front and stabilizer bar and semi floating axle in the rear. The underbody features heavy duty skid plates to protect sensitive areas like transfer case, fuel tank, radiator, etc.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Meet GLS &ndash; the S class equivalent of 4-wheel drive SUVs when you need to go off the road and at the same time, would like to enjoy the very best of luxury that can be offered only by <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a>. The largest SUV from Mercedes stable, the GLS can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">seat 7 able bodied adults</span> in absolute comfort and can glide over broken rocks and streams on the way to your farmhouse, or on the trail to that elusive camping ground. Or, if you decide so, can haul in excess of 2600-liter of cargo if you tumble down the seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GLS-Class, or the facelifted GL-Class, was born when Mercedes decided to change the name of its current GL range of SUVs to GLS along with the mild facelift, so that the naming now aligns with the rest of the family. The current nomenclature makes it easier for the layman to identify each SUV model and the role it plays in the family portfolio by tightly aligning the SUVs against their sedan counterparts. So, the GLA is the SUV counterpart of A-class, GLC (old GLK) is the alter ego of C-class, GLE (renamed ML-Class) is the partner of E-class and <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/passenger-cars/g-class/the-g-class-model-year-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GLS</a> (erstwhile GL-Class) is the brawny sibling of the suave <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.co.in/content/india/mpc/mpc_india_website/enng/home_mpc/passengercars/home/new_cars/models/s-class/w222.flash.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">S-class</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since this is a midlife facelift, the changes are not really apparent in a casual glance and subtle in nature. The front end is slightly redesigned and gets a new headlight cluster and a new grill with twin slats, dominated by the big three pointed star. The hood too has seen mild rework and spots power bulges. The changes at the rear are limited to the new <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">LED tail lights and restyled bumper</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The designers have added few CHROME accents to make the boxy structure more elegant, and there is a new alloy wheel design to complete the new looks. A sports package with re-designed bumpers featuring three mesh air dams, side skirts, spoiler and 21-inch alloy wheels are also available, though is not standard across the range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These changes are much more pronounced inside the cabin &ndash; the 3-spoke multifunction steering wheel, the redesigned instrument cluster, the configurable HIGH DEFINITION TFT screen et al &ndash; the change list is huge. The SUV gains the huge HD 8-inch touchpad enabled <strong>COMAND module</strong> that can be used by both, the driver and the front passengers, to navigate through the infotainment system. The redesigned interior is more cohesive and brings the interior more in-line with the current family look, though the flowing look of the new S class is still lacking. The interior is dominated by acres of top class leather and wood, as expected, and you can CUSTOMIZE the leather options. The front seats are ventilated and come with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">massage function</span> and the middle and the third come with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">power assist fold function</span> that makes it easier to fold and stow the seats away to make way for your precious cargo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine lineup includes three non-AMG spec models and a top of the line <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-amg.com/gls63.php?lang=eng\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes AMG GLS63 model</a>. There are two gasoline engine options among the non AMG models &ndash; the twin turbo <strong>3.0-liter V6</strong> churning out a maximum of 362hp and 369 lb-ft of power and torque, respectively, and the big brother, the <strong>4.7-liter bi-turbo V8</strong> with 449hp of power and 516lb-ft of torque at peak. The range also has an oil burner, the ever dependable <strong>3.0 liter V6 turbo diesel</strong>, rated to a maximum of 255hp and 455lb-ft of torque. The boffins at AMG have placed the massive <strong>twin turbo 5.5-liter V8</strong> unit, developing a maximum power of 577hp and 561lb-ft torque, to equip this massive SUV with equally massive power, under the hood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes in the facelift are not limited to the interiors or the powertrain &ndash; even the mechanicals have been refreshed and seen more changes than the exteriors or the interiors. The non AMG models are now mated with a new 9-speed automatic with a ratio of 9.17:1. According to the equipment level and options ticked, the SUV comes either with 5 or 6 different driving modes and unless you engage the sports mode, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SUV will start from second gear</span> to ensure a smooth, vibration free start up experience. The new gearbox has been in development for five years and has been optimized for performance and efficiency that uses two pumps (one always on mechanical and one on demand electronic pump) that generate the required HYDRAULIC PRESSURE for smooth operation, and aids quick re-ignition during the engine start-stop operation. The AMG model, GLS63, will continue to come with the tried and tested 7-speed automatic unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another area that has gone under the knife and has been upgraded is the ADJUSTABLE modes for GLS&#39;s chassis. The non AMG models come with Comfort, Sport, Individual and Off Road modes and can opt for the Off-Road engineering package that improves the ground clearance by around 3 inches, comes with a low range transfer case and locking central differential, and adds an Off-Road+ mode to the driving modes. In addition to this, the AMG model will have a Sport+ setting to harness all that massive power churned out. And oh, all the models come fitted with the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">4MATIC four-wheel drive system</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected from Mercedes, the GLS comes kitted with an impressive array of safety and assist features. They include multiple airbags, blind spot monitoring, active lane keep assist, attention assist, PRE-Safe, pedestrian detect with automatic braking assist, crosswind assist, collision prevention assist plus, Distronic plus &ndash; the list is nearly endless. Also, the car can be kitted with adaptive damping on top of the <strong>AIRMATIC suspension</strong> and an adaptive windscreen wiper system, for those cold wintery days. The car also gets remote start, powered tailgate, and driver&#39;s seat with multiple memory settings, in addition to the huge list of standard features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This behemoth of the SUV can only be surpassed by a Maybach level SUV and though there are faint indicators from Mercedes that the company may actually bring one &ndash; to compete with the Bentley <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/bentley-bentayga-a-take-on-the-ultra-suv\">Bentayga</a> and the upcoming Rolls-Royce SUV, there is no indication of the timeline for the launch. If and when it happens, we may not see a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SUV bigger than GLS</span>, but will see an SUV that is dimensionally similar, but with a lot more kit and caboodle to pamper the occupants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes has recently imported the <strong>GLS350D 4MATIC</strong> model to India for homologation purpose, indicating that the launch is indeed near &ndash; we can be assured that this is one of the promised <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/top-five-cars-to-watch-out-in-2016\">launches</a> for the year 2016.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>You might think that the title itself is little exaggerated; however, we will never claim something so serious without strong back-up points. We agree that not everyone will eventually own a Lexus LS but that doesn&#39;t mean you can never?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe not everyone is a born <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lexus/ls\">Lexus LS</a> driver; some learn the hard way. After reading this article you will definitely yearn to own this award winning, performance-oriented and one of the HOTTEST wheels in the world. We will be talking about as many qualities as we can (unfortunately, an article does have limited words) that might make you regret why your garage isn&#39;t honored to keep the majestic Lexus LS.<br />\r\nLet&#39;s talk about the <strong><em>REGALITY</em></strong> of the Lexus:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sophistication does have a name: CONNOISSEURS call it &#39;Lexus&#39;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s admit it, &quot;Lexus LS is sophistication personified&quot;. LS is not only known for its comfort driving, but also for the ambiance it offers to its passengers. The luxury sedan promises to lend a sense of &#39;Classiness&#39; and &#39;Flamboyance&#39; to your journey. The complete seating package, from driver&#39;s seat to the rear passengers, include best of the features like power-reclining cozy rear seats, in-built ottoman-style leg rest, fine leather seats along with a folding wood-trimmed console table to enjoy snack-time et al. It&#39;s truly a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>luxurious cruise on wheels</em></span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>With Power Comes Great Responsibilities: Lexus Engines Strictly Obey It</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every car needs a <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/LS/specifications\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">powerful engine</a> to become a crowning glory on the road and Lexus knows this fact by heart. The LS is powered by an impressive 386-hp V8 engine, and the LS 600h L&mdash;the world&#39;s first luxury and AWD V8 hybrid &ndash; roars maximum power of up to <strong>438hp</strong> and resolved to go from 0-60mph in just 5.5 seconds. Its butter-like steering offers smooth shifting and provide a quiet, steady and powerful drive on any terrain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When the Engine Roars, Safety Becomes Top Priority: LS Owners Feel Safe</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Pushing an accelerator of a car that doesn&#39;t provide sound safety is like standing on a landmine going to click anytime. Lexus&#39; technicians work meticulously to make its cars &#39;CRASH PROOF&#39;. LS models are laced with standard and optional safety features like adaptive headlights, airbags, blind spot monitor, forward collision warning system, adaptive cruise control, and so on. Moreover, under Lexus&#39; hi-tech pre-collision system, you will get a driver attention monitor and corrective steering movement to stay in the lane. With a top score in crashworthiness conducted by <strong>IIHS</strong>, Lexus gives you peace of mind while driving.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>An Array of Advanced Electronics: Fully Abreast of Cutting-Edge Technology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lexus LS has always been a vision when it comes to hi-tech gadgets. However, in 2015, the company went little more serious about this element and fixed latest systems like App Integration System to get an access to the apps like Pandora, Slacker and iHeartRadio Internet radio services, navigation, Bluetooth and audio streaming, SIRI integration, USB/iPod inputs and high quality stereo speakers. Be ready for one HELLUVA drive!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Extreme Testing before you Drive: LS goes through Rigorous Prototype Testing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lexus\">Lexus</a></strong> understands the importance of prototype testing and takes it very seriously. The length Lexus goes to help make <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">premium cars</a> is commendable. The complete prototype testing procedure ensures that all the electronic systems perfectly function under any atmospheric pressure. In addition to subjecting the prototypes to extreme temperatures ranging from 225 degrees to 30 degrees or below, there is a mandatory harsh electromagnetic interference testing in a big chamber to make sure all the electronic systems such as television waves, solar radiation and lightning don&#39;t get affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rigid body and Responsive Paint: Luxurious Shouldn&#39;t just be Seen it Should also be FELT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lexus has always put its soul in the making of LS models. Taking care of every minute detail is the key to becoming &#39;DADDY&#39; of the automobile industry. Car&#39;s body and its paint is something not to ignore. Under harsh weather conditions, it&#39;s not just an engine but also the body that puts a great fight. LS comes with scratch-resistant paint that is <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">capable of repairing itself</span> from light dents and minor scratches. The paint experts at Lexus follow 6-layered paint system out of which two base coats are designed in such a way that they react differently under sun and cloud. The large aluminum flakes in the first base coat sparkle under sunlight while smaller flakes twinkle under cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from these qualities, the procedure to make every engine worth putting in Lexus LS is rigorous and will definitely blow your mind. Don&#39;t believe us? Read on!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus Mechanics Are No Less Than Doctors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every Lexus LS engine stands on the line of fire before even being considered as a part of the car. Yes! Each and every engine is HANDPICKED and personally tested on the &#39;Assembly Balancer&#39; where a skilled technician inspects it inside out, without skipping even a single beat. The technicians use stethoscope (metaphorically) to listen a running engine&#39;s humming, making sure it sounds perfect when you drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dust-Free Labs to Keep the Engines Safe from Any Kind of Contamination</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lexus</a> clearly seems to be obsessed with keeping micron-size particles away from precision components. After exhaustive testing process, every engine is kept secluded in a lab-like room inside dust-free containers before assembling. All the workers have to undergo &quot;air showers&quot; before entering the lab, and all the parts get multiple high-power vacuums before getting assembled in the car. Some may consider this procedure a bit rigid and over the top, however, we believe that making reliable cars is not a joke and Lexus seems to be completely focused on manufacturing safe and premium cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Metal that Stands for Indisputable STRENGTH</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lexus uses top-of-the-line aluminum and its quality is ensured at the liquid metal stage. The molten aluminum contains minimal gases that help in making strong parts of the vehicle. It&#39;s quite impressive and interesting to see the company&#39;s determination to produce state-of-the-art vehicles for its customers. Lexus is really popular in the industry for using superior quality of aluminum and also its commitment of in-house care to the raw materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, we are not done yet. Didn&#39;t we tell you, it&#39;s difficult to stop? So, before coming to an end, let&#39;s come to a conclusion that Lexus has always been at the forefront of innovation, and thus, has introduced many &quot;firsts&quot; in the industry. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"listblog\">\r\n\t<li>The world&#39;s first <strong>luxury hybrid</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>The world&#39;s first <strong>eight-speed automatic transmission</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>The world&#39;s first <strong>LED headlamps</strong></li>\r\n\t<li>The world&#39;s first <strong>pedestrian-detection system</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, now, you know the brains invested into making every Lexus LS are just IMPECCABLE. Such are the visionaries who are thinking about your NEXT LS by adhering to the stringent qualitative process that demand an obsession for detail.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

With the several number of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/aston-martin\">limited edition cars</a>, the surge it creates during the <a href=\"https://www.salon-auto.ch/fr/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Geneva Auto Show</a> is felt with its dominance over the approach. Constantly redefining the essence of proper GTs, the lust for these cars has risen with every launch. And when you know your ride is like that of <a href=\"https://www.astonmartin.com/en/heritage/james-bond\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">JAMES BOND&#39;s</a>; there is no feeling like it! The V12 sound, the long bonnets and the ride, are enough for any man to fall in love with. With the upcoming futuristic designs and technological uplifts, the excitement is sure to rise further. Let&#39;s check out the models and what distinguishes them;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>VANQUISH</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"VANQUISH\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/VANQUISH1.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://cdntbs.astonmartin.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.astonmartin.com/cars/the-new-vanquish\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">legendary &quot;Super Grand Touring&quot; Machine</a> was penned down by Ian Callum, which joined the fleet with DB7. The immediate response was astounding with showcasing in the 2002 James Bond movie. <strong>The revamped version, launched in 2015, has 105 more HORSES enough to reach a 320+ Kmph scale. The initial Vanquish packed in 456PS and 510Nm of power and torque at the launch, but it was way less powered when compared to its competitors. Realizing the issue, Aston Martin launched the Vanquish S, based on the VH platform, which lasted till 2007.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DB9</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"DB9\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Aston_martin_DB9-02.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://fiorisima.com/.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>As Jeremy Clarkson says,</strong> <em class=\"dimText\">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but having an Aston Martin DB9 on the drive and not driving it is a bit like having Keira Knightley in your bed and sleeping on the couch.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successor of the famous DB7, <span class=\"redText\">DB9 was extensively engineered to replace the most selling Aston!</span> The VH Platform, launched in 2004, imbibed with Aston DNA pumped new blood in the Frame of Astons, inundated with Aluminium and Carbon Fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText bigText\">The platform also showcased the different innovations in Vehicle Dynamics. The key highlight was the Adaptive Damping System that is still featured as a STANDARD! But the most evocative feature was the design language, evolved by Ian Callum, and the design cues involved in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alike the present DB11, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">DB9 was the torch bearer for the future Astons</span> featuring magnesium in many components and slashing the conventional Machining processes. The rear wheel drive, the V12, the waterfall console and the accentuated headlights were the key changes. With constant revamping, DB9 GT was the model that rolled before its discontinuation. DB9 has always been the most likeable Aston and DB9 GT being the BEST among all!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>VIRAGE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"VIRAGE\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Aston_martin_VIRAGE.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://xdesktopwallpapers.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/aston-martin/virage\">Virage joined the Aston lineup</a> in the V-8 era. Being on the softer side of GT, Virage sold off with the DB7 during the 90s. Soon with the launch of Vanquish and Vantage, it got overshadowed. In 2011, a new <strong>AVATAR</strong> of Virage was born with a purpose to draw the fine line between DB9 and DBS with a more powerful V12 powertrain and also shares the 2+2 configuration with Rapide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DBS</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"DBS\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Aston_martin_DBS.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://cdn.pinthiscars.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Calling it simply an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_DBS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ICONIC CAR</a> won&#39;t justify the DBS&#39;s hugely successful and glorious journey. Ever since its launch in 1960s, it has gained a celebrity status by claiming spots in two of the James Bond&#39;s movies. Initially launched with a straight six, this sexy beast then switched to a V-8 engine followed by the latest being the 510bhp V-12. DBS was engineered to be sportier than DB9, with a greater track width and lower clearance. <span class=\"redText bigText\">The final edition of DBS was the Carbon black, a MASTERPIECE some say but was one of the limited edition cars.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RAPIDE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"RAPIDE\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Aston_martin_RAPIDE1.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://celdlearning.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Aston in 2005 released a one-of-a-kind 4-door car. With some rigorous designing, Aston engineers fit the rear doors, and also kept the opening in a typical swan type. With the typical headlights like that of Vanquish, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/aston-martin/rapide\">Aston Martin Rapide</a> with a longer wheelbase was one of the costliest in the lineup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>The revamped version of this killer beauty, released in 2010, was packed with 80 more horses and was profoundly called the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Rapide S</span>. With this, it entered the 320+ kilometers per hour bandwagon, all thanks to the upgraded transmission system also called the ZF Transmission that has been extremely well tuned.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, Aston launched the first electric vehicle under the Rapide platform, justifying its cost. Rapide E, the name packed in Lithium Ions all over to deliver the typical Rapide performance figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>VANTAGE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"VANTAGE\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Aston_martin_VANTAGE.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://downloadwallpaperhd.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Astons might be very synonymous with V-12 but they thought of making an exception to fit their car in the lower segment accompanying their lesser sportier Virage. <span class=\"redText\">Falling in the high speed GT category, according to Aston, and being the highest sold, Vantage is also used by the <a href=\"https://www.astonmartin.com/en/racing/series/fia-wec\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Aston Racing team at World Championships</a> for its greater adaptability and compactness, thus allowing it to be quicker. V12 also eventually went into its blood in 2007 with the famous &quot;Sportshift&quot; option, the lightened flywheel</span>. To make Vantage sportier, just like Ferrari has got a &quot;SPORTS PACK&quot; for the 458, Aston too features its Vantage with stiffer suspensions, the Dual throttle mapping devices and many more light weighted components. With the tradition, Vantage too got S suffixed in 2011 and a bit more carbon-fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The best looking Vantage though, always remains the convertible one!</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

But then cars top everything. We all fantasize <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">driving premium cars</a> of top brands &ndash; Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lamborghini, to name a few. Just when a car zooms off in front of us, blowing away the sand, all we can do is drool over the model and wish of driving that mesmerizing beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\">Let&#39;s take a short sneak peek into one such beauty, <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>AUDI A7</em></span></strong>, which a person with a stretchable pocket can easily afford to fulfill his dream of driving a luxury car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\">If you are looking for a curvaceous car that can bear any kind of weather and still manage to run smoothly, then Audi A7 is best for you. It is a luxurious sedan that has enough space and facilities. With sleeker styling than the A6, the A7 is the first choice of masses and definitely <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/a6\">more expensive than the A6</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>EXTERNAL FEATURES</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On the exterior fronts, the new Audi A7 comes with a rear spoiler, a sunroof, oval shaped exhausts with chrome garnishing on all the major door handles and last, but not the least heated OVRM.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Audi A7 EXTERNAL FEATURES\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/EXTERNAL-FEATURES.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.behance.net</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>INTERIOR and DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The LED headlights take on more of a squint and the shape of exhaust outlets has turned rectangular. It is more about the physical beauty and the making that gives and an attractive appearance to the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LED indicators at the front and rear have a neat scrolling function, so they flash in the direction you are turning. Hence, it will be a nice and smooth ride even in the <strong>ODD HOURS OF THE NIGHT</strong>. The taillights are also pretty much same as headlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The A7&#39;s dynamic LED headlights are highly responsive toward traffic. These LED headlights enhance the visibility during night and have sensor enabled traffic detector individual bulbs that get dim on traffic detection.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slick dashboard design is one of the best till date and provides enough space to keep your stuff. There is also a hi-tech optional kit that includes a reversing camera and <span class=\"redText\">Audi&#39;s Technology pack</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This car is huge enough with low slung body and a strong forefront. At the front, you will find Audi&#39;s trademark and LED headlights, while on the rear end it features a retractable spoiler at the end of the sloping roof-line, which gives it a nice and attractive appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\">A7 has overall leather upholstery. The interior is designed with <strong>RED</strong> color. There are lots of pockets all over the car to keep variety of other common stuff. It has enough leg space so you will be comfortable in long journeys too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the aforementioned specs, it comes equipped with Air Quality control, Low Fuel warning, Climate control, BOSE Sound System and Trunk Light enhancing the overall comfort level of the user.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>POWER and MILEAGE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\">Audi </a></strong>A7 is available in two variants &ndash; PETROL and DIESEL. <strong> Both the engines are super powerful. It can go from 0 to 100mph in just 6.3 seconds. A7 comes in a 3.0-litre, V6 cylinder diesel engine, having a displacement capacity of 2967cc.</strong> The power packed performance of the A7 engine is delivered with an exhaust gas turbo charging system. The company has rightfully claimed that on highways it has the ability to give a mileage of 14.40Kmpl, while for the city lovers it gives a mileage of some 10Kmpl. Additionally, it generates a power of 241.3bhp with a peak torque output of 500Nm at just 1400 to 3250 rpm.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Audi A7 POWER-and-MILEAGE\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/POWER-and-MILEAGE.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://cdntbs.astonmartin.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAFETY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping its customers safe is of utmost importance for every car manufacturer these days and Audi A7 manufacturers have certainly kept this fact in mind since they have equipped the new luxury beast with a bundle of safety equipment&#39;s that majorly includes multiple Air bags and child locks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\">To avoid skidding of tires, it has been featured with <strong>hydraulic brake assists</strong> along with <strong>anti-lock braking system</strong>. Some of the other safety equipment&#39;s that make it a Numero-Uno choice are Crash Sensor, Engine Check Warning and Engine Immobilizer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What mesmerizes the car lover and adds to the safety quotient is its light weight aluminum construction with side impact protection beams and crumple zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>COLORS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\">You can buy Audi</a> A7 in the following color variants:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"listblog\">\r\n\t<li>Ice Silver Metallic</li>\r\n\t<li>Daytona Grey Pearl Effect</li>\r\n\t<li>Dakota Grey Metallic</li>\r\n\t<li>Havana Black Metallic</li>\r\n\t<li>Garnet Red Pearl Effect</li>\r\n\t<li>Ibis White</li>\r\n\t<li>Daytona Grey Pear; Effect</li>\r\n\t<li>Brilliant Black</li>\r\n\t<li>Oolong Grey Metallic</li>\r\n\t<li>Quartz Grey Metallic</li>\r\n\t<li>Phantom Black Pearl Effect</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Audi A7 SAFETY\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/SAFETY.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://cdntbs.astonmartin.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>COMFORT and SPACE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Audi A7 Sport back is a large, four-door coupe based on the A6 executive saloon model. Though there is no central seat-belt, but still it can accommodate one extra passenger in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audi A7 features sufficient storage in the front cabin as well. But apart from all the positive aspects one thing that makes it looks down is its roof-line that gives a poor visibility to the driver. So, to counter that user can get optional rear &ndash; view camera by paying few extra bucks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SIZE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\">This beautiful car is 4,974 mm in length, 1,911 mm in width and 1,420 mm in height. The car is greatly spacious and has better size than its competitors. The leg space gives you great comfort while allowing you to relax while during a long journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, you can also <a href=\"https://audi.us/1PkOxpi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CUSTOMIZE your own Audi</strong></a> as per your taste and preference.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>The flagship sedan from <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw/7-series\">BMW 7 series</a></strong> has carved its own niche in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">luxury car market</a>. Introduced in late 70&#39;s, the car has been a launch platform for all the cutting edge tech and luxury features, though it is surely aimed at the <strong>TOP STRATA</strong> of the luxury car buying clientele who are tech savvy as well as luxury carving. The car retains the sportiness character to an extent and it is rewarding either to take the car for a spin when you are in the mood to get behind the wheel, or when you urge to lounge on the supremely comfortable heated and ventilated rear leather seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/bmw_design/process.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The BMW designs</a> are never overly dramatic, and have an understated elegance that is appreciated by many. The new 7 series is not an exception to this. The exterior is tastefully done up in a conservative manner so that no one finds the design offensive. The front is dominated by a large BMW signature twin kidney grill (<span class=\"redText\">which also manages the airflow for greater efficiency and is called Active Kidney Grill</span>), and the side profile is spruced up by the beautiful beltline and the sculptured air breather. The car can be shod with either 19-inch or 20-inch wheels, adding to the visual sensation. The rear gets a subtle chrome accent bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>INTERIOR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior is another <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/7series/sedan/2015/showroom/comfort_and_ambience.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">story of wellbeing and comfort</a> though &ndash; Step inside and the driver is greeted with a well-proportioned meaty steering wheel and a 12.3-inch <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">HIGH DEFINITION DRIVER CLUSTER</span></strong>. There are acres of finest quality leather and wood and lovingly sculptured metal switchgears. The headliner can be kitted with a Sky lounge LED roof that has more than 15,000 individual etchings and 6 ambient light colors to give you the beautiful experience of grazing at a starlight sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The rear legroom is up by an inch and now offers better rear seat leg room than competitors. The rear can be decked up with a number of packages, if you prefer to spend more time at the rear. The car gets heated arm rests (for both front and rear), in addition to the heated and ventilated seats. The rear can be spiced up with a massage function and something called as <strong>VITALITY FUNCTION</strong>, which as per BMW, will revitalize your body by engaging the passengers in active training during long journeys.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rear is kitted with an executive lounge seating package that elevates the cabin to first class level. Such packages give the rear passengers extra leg room, footrest, fold out table, extra cup holders and even a separate storage space. You can personalize the air you breathe by selecting the <strong><em>Ambient Air Package</em></strong>, which ionizes and purifies the air and peppers it with your preferable fragrance, from an available list of eight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ADVANCE FEATURES</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW 7 Series Advance-Features\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Advance-Features.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://4.bp.blogspot.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many industry first enhancements that take this <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw/7-series\">7 series</a> to a different plane altogether. The car is equipped with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDrive\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>latest version of iDrive</em></a> and comes with gesture control as standard. With a wave of your hand or with a twirl of your finger, now you can control the iDrive that can change songs, accept or reject a call &ndash; for example, <span class=\"redText\">you can accept an incoming call by pointing your finger at the infotainment system while a dismissive wave of your wrist reject the call.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can program a two-finger point to do a host of things, like playing your favorite track, setting your favorite destination in the navigation system, or even making a call to a particular number &ndash; the possibilities are wide. The rear passenger gets a removable 7 inch touchscreen to control the parameters of the car. The 7 series is equipped with 5 different ways to <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/7series/sedan/2015/showroom/innovative_functionality.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interact with the iDrive</a> &ndash; <span class=\"redText\"><em>the gesture control, voice commands, touch screen, the rear tablet and the standard knob</em></span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>Another <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/7series/sedan/2015/showroom/driver_assistance.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">driver assistance innovation</a> is the Display key &ndash; it is much more than just a key for the car. This key comes with a touchscreen and provides all the vital information at your fingertips &ndash; like open window or door positions, estimated range and fuel status; and comes with wireless charging &ndash; you just need to drop this in the wireless charging pocket in the front console and it will be charged automatically. This wireless charging can be utilized by your smartphone also. Moreover, you can also park your car fully automatically using this key fob.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AUDIO SYSTEM</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The car also comes with studio grade sound system from Bowers&amp;Wilkins, which has 16 speakers and employ <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Diamond tweeter dome technology with Nautilus design</span>, which helps to reduce resonance while maximizing the clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAFETY FEATURES</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW 7 Series Safety-Features\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Safety-Features.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.slashgear.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The car comes with a truck load of safety systems. Sample this &ndash; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">this car can steer by itself, can reduce or increase cruising speed according to the limits, can brake automatically to avoid collisions</span> &ndash; to put it in a nutshell, this car can do anything and everything we think about &ndash; well, almost. The ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL uses data from navigation system and cameras that read the signs and reminds the driver about the change in speed limits &ndash; the driver can accept it by either pushing the speed up or down button and the car will adjust the speed automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The car can keep self-steer centered in its lane itself, for speeds of up to 210kmph, and comes with rear cross traffic alert, pedestrian detection and forward collision warning with auto braking, lane departure warning and prevention, etc. If the car detects a lane change move or detects another vehicle in the adjacent lane, it will warn the driver by giving feedback through steering wheel, and can correct the course of the car automatically to avoid collision.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The automatic parking is another tech jewel the BMW 7 series flagship sedan comes with &ndash; you can whip out the display key fob and can use it to park the car or reverse it from the parking lot or from a garage, while you are outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DYNAMICS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheer size of the BMW 7 series will make one think that this car will gently waft but will wallow around corners &ndash; but think not. The car comes with a revolutionary carbon core &ndash; most of the unibody and the center tunnel are made of carbon fiber and this have helped BMW to save the weight (the car have lost around 90kgs of weight compared to the previous generation) and have kept the center of gravity low, allowing the car to be nimble and quicker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\">The car boasts <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">adjustable suspension components</span>, has adaptive driving modes and even has an Active Comfort Drive system, with combined Road Preview that adjusts the chassis according to the data obtained from navigation system for optimal comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ENGINE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW 7 Series  Engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Engine.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://autosof2016.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>The car is powered by a revised 4.4-liter V8 with 2 twin scroll turbos, with peak outputs at 445hp and 480 lb-ft of power and torque, respectively. This engine is mated to a state-of-the-art ZF make 8-speed automatic transmission. There is also a 3.0-liter V6 on offer that churns out 330hp, and will do duty on lower spec models.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this 7 series, BMW has incorporated the magic that was missing from the previous generation, and the car has all the bells and whistles and comes with the old school BMW genes &ndash; the car do not feel like a lifeless computer controlled luxury liner, but more like a magic carpet that can steer and pamper you alike.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The original road-going Hummer H1 was based around the <a href=\"https://www.amgeneral.com/vehicles/hmmwv/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">American army&#39;s military vehicle Humvee</a>. <em>While the H1 was a very capable machine, and then some, its bulky dimensions and purpose built mechanicals were a little too much unless you were planning to raid the middle-east.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To cater to the needs of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/hummer/h3\">people who wanted a Hummer</a> with daily-usability while also not compromising on its off-road capabilities, GM &ndash; the parent company of Hummer brand, introduced the H2 and H3 models. Again, while the former was noticeably successful, it was mostly the latter that made the <strong>Hummer brand famous</strong> in every nook and corner of the world &ndash; <em>quite literally</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduced in the year 2005, the H3 was the smallest (relatively, of course) of all the models in the Hummer range. <em class=\"redText\">The Hummer H3 perfectly captured the essence of the original Humvee, but in a more modern and right-sized body for the road. It was underpinned by the company&#39;s GMT355 platform that also formed base for the Chevrolet Colarado and GMC Canyon compact pick-up trucks.</em> <a href=\"https://www.hummer.com/vehicles/hummer_vehicles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Hummer H3</a> was made available in 2 iterations &ndash; normal SUV or as a mid-size truck (H3T). GM produced the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/hummer\">Hummer</a></strong> H3 in three different locations &ndash; USA, South Africa and Russia &ndash; across the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Engine &amp; Gearbox</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Calling a Hummer H3 &#39;<strong>SMALL</strong>&#39; is a bit inappropriate, actually. <em class=\"redText\">It stands out from other SUVs in the same way as Hulk would in a crowd of mere mortals</em>. To lug the bulk of this hulk of a car was never going to be an easy affair for engineers at GM then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of its launch in 2005, <strong class=\"darkText\"><em>the H3 featured a 3.5-litre straight-5 cylinder petrol engine that developed 220PS of maximum power and 305Nm of peak torque</em></strong>. The engine came mated to either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, GM realized this was not good enough, so the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">automobile manufacturer increased the cubic capacity of the engine to 3.7-litre</span> while the power and torque figures also got a bump to 242PS and 328Nm, respectively. These engines were reasonably efficient as well!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For people needing a little extra from the H3 in terms of performance, the SUV was also offered with a monstrous <strong class=\"darkText\">5.3-liter LH8 V8 petrol engine rated at 300PS and 430 Nm</strong>, starting from 2008. The V8 motor was only made available with an automatic gearbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Off-road Capabilities</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Hummer H3 Off-road Capabilities\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Off-road-capabilities.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://9walls.in</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Buying a Hummer based on its power figures or on-road performance would be the last thing one would consider before getting one home. The Hummer H3, like the military&#39;s Humvee, is made to take on terrains where no other vehicle could even dare to tread. Simply put, the word &quot;<em><strong>GO-ANYWHERE</strong></em>&quot; is what defines the capabilities of all the Hummer models, including the H3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The H3 was equipped with a two-speed, electronically controlled full-time four-wheel drive system, making the Hummer effortless to drive both off-road and on-road. Customers could also opt for electronic locking front and rear differentials, if interested in hardcore off-roader.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among some of the H3&#39;s off-road capabilities, the H3 could drive in 610mm of water in depths of up to 787mm at a speed of 8km/h. Speeds of up to 32km/h could also be achieved while wading across 406mm of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\">The ground clearance of the H3 was measured 246mm, as per the official record, whereas, the approach, departure and brake-over angles of 37.4&deg;, 34.7&deg;, and 22.1&deg;, respectively, would make the H3 take on a 406mm vertical wall with ease. Gradients of 60% and side slopes of 40% could also be negotiated with the vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\">All in all, the Hummer H3 is not just a thing to flaunt driving around in a town, it&#39;s the vehicle you can take and flaunt in any part of the world irrespective of the terrain. The Hummer H3 also competed in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Dakar_Rally\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2010 edition of Dakar Rally</a> &ndash; the toughest and most grueling rally in the world - finishing at eighth spot overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAFETY</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Hummer H3 SAFETY\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/safety-features-2.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://futurecarreleases.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Safety is one of the prime concerns, especially when we talk about a car of this size and stature. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummer_H3#Safety\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hummer H3&#39;s</a> safety net include electronic stability control, dual front airbags, anti-lock braking disc brakes, brake-controlled traction control and tyre-pressure monitoring system as standard across all the variants.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While side-curtain airbags were offered as optional till 2008, the company made it a part of the standard kit in future models. Thanks to all of the safety systems, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)</a> awarded the Hummer H3 <strong class=\"redText\">5 out of 5 stars</strong> in frontal driver protection and <strong class=\"redText\">4 out 5</strong> in passenger safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the Hummer H3 models produced were made in left-hand drive configuration. However, once GM set up the production plant for Hummer vehicles in South Africa in 2007, the production facility started manufacturing right-hand drive versions for Australian markets in addition to catering to domestic supplies. <strong><em>This factory also manufactured Hummer models for Asian and European markets.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Production of the Hummer H3, or any other Hummer vehicle for that matter, was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>discontinued after an economic downturn at GM in 2010</em></span>. With that being said, it doesn&#39;t take the legacy of the Hummer H3 away in any way. Even today, the demand for the Hummer H3 has been hitting the roof in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">used luxury car market</a>. It&#39;s perhaps for the same reason that you see Bollywood stars, cricketers, rappers, singers, etc. driving IN AND AROUND THE TOWN in the Hummer H3</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IT IS AN AUTOMOTIVE ICON THAT SIMPLY REFUSES TO DIE!</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>With the Crossfire, <a href=\"https://www.chrysler.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler Motor Company</a> took a shot at making a rear-wheel drive, 2-door sports car. Built between 2004 and 2008, the Chrysler Crossfire was manufactured by Karmann of Germany. The most interesting bit about the 2-door roadster is the fact that it was co-developed with Mercedes-Benz (Chrysler and Daimler were partners back then).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>First shown as a concept in 2001, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Crossfire\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler Crossfire</a> was based on the Mercedes&#39; R170 platform, meaning it shared as much as 80 per cent of the components with Mercedes-Benz SLK320 that was built around the same time. In 2005, Mercedes developed R171 platform and moved the SLK-Class to that. <strong>The R170 platform was entirely made available for the Chrysler Crossfire.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the company, the name Crossfire signifies the two character lines in the car&#39;s design that run from front to rear, crossing each other midway through the door. The name also refers to the collaboration between the two companies &ndash; <span class=\"redText\"><strong>Daimler of Germany and Chrysler of America</strong>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Design</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Crossfire was based on the same underpinnings as of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/slk-class\">Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class of that generation</a>, Chrysler designed the interior and exterior itself. The rest of the mechanical components such as the engine, transmission, chassis structure, suspension components, are lifted directly from the <strong><em>R170 platform based SLK320</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>One of the similarities between the two models was that engine bay of the Crossfire was almost identical to the Mercedes-Benz SLK320. In fact, the seats from the Mercedes-Benz SLK320 could be fitted directly into the Crossfire&#39;s chassis. The dashboard layout, features and instruments also had a hint of Mercedes-Benz SLK320. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What that means then is that the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Crossfire is the fusion of American masculinity and German engineering</span>. You couldn&#39;t ask for a better combination, could you?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Engine, Transmission &amp; Suspension:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Chrysler Crossfire Engine-Transmission\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Engine-Transmission.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Sourc: https://upload.wikimedia.org</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sales of the Chrysler Crossfire commenced early in 2004. <em class=\"redText\"><strong>The 2004 Chrysler Crossfire was powered by a Mercedes-Benz derived 3.2-litre 18-valve SOHC V6 petrol engine that developed 215bhp of maximum power output and 310Nm of peak torque</strong></em>. Since Mercedes was involved in the engineering and development of the Crossfire, the German automaker&#39;s AMG division also did their bit with the Chrysler derivative of the two-seater. The SRT-6 version of the car came fitted with the Mercedes-AMG sourced supercharged engine. <em class=\"redText\"><strong>This engine was also a 3.2-litre V6 petrol motor, but it was rated at 330 bhp and 420 Nm of peak power and torque.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transmission options included a 6-speed manual as standard while an optional 5-speed automatic was also offered. SRT-6 models were only made available with a 5-speed automatic transmission though. Both <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the transmissions were also sourced from Mercedes-Benz</span>. Surprisingly, the automatic variants of the car had better fuel efficiency over the manual version &ndash; which is not the case, generally. This was achieved by tinkering with the gear-ratios in the automatic version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Chrysler Crossfire did not incorporate a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>rack and pinion steering system</strong></a> that is generally fitted in cars. In place, it used a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recirculating_ball\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>recirculating ball system</strong></a>, thanks to platform sharing with the Mercedes-Benz SLK320. The front suspension setup was double wishbone type while the rear wheels employed 5 point multi-link setup. Two wheel sizes were offered in all variants of the Crossfire - 18-inch or 19-inch.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Features and Equipment:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Chrysler Crossfire Features-and-Equipment\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Features-and-Equipment.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Sourc: https://upload.wikimedia.org</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Equipment-wise, the Chrysler Crossfire trumped almost every other car in its segment &ndash; it was loaded to gills! <em>Even the base model of the car featured alloy wheels with performance-tyres, a Becker-sourced stereo with anti-theft and a single-disc CD player, air-conditioning, keyless entry and exit with security alarm, a power-retractable spoiler, leather seats and steering wheel, power-retractable roof (convertible models), dual-power front bucket seats, full instrumentation, etc.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Optional extras included an automatic transmission, a 6-speaker Infinity sound system with 2 subwoofers mounted directly behind seats, a CD based GPS navigational system, additional exterior shades and interior trim choices. The SRT-6 version&#39;s cabin came finished in a unique leather/alcantara upholstery. In addition to that, the Crossfire SRT-6 was fitted with uprated suspension and brakes and a redesigned front fascia with an air dam. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Most the mechanical components were shared with SLK32 AMG</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Conclusion\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Conclusion.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Sourc: https://www.conceptcarz.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler Crossfire was built in both coupe and roadster (convertible) body formats. Production of the Chrysler Crossfire was mostly limited to the European markets. In fact, <em><strong>only fewer units were exported to the USA and Mexico in the year 2006, of which mostly were roadsters.</strong></em> Chrysler discontinued the Crossfire in 2008 after the last model rolled off the assembly line in December 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Close to 76,000 units of the Chrysler Crossfire were sold before its production was ceased. Sales peaked in 2005 when Chrysler managed to sell over 35,000 units of the car. Chrysler manufactured the car in both RHD and LHD configurations, which eventually helped it gain popularity in different markets.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler Crossfire is a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">rare breed of sportscar</a>. It may be a Mercedes-Benz SLK under the skin, but on the outside it has something unique about it, it has that special Chrysler and American charm about it. Also, compared to the Mercedes-Benz SLK, the Crossfire sold in fewer numbers, making it even rarer. If you&#39;ve a thing for a &quot;different&quot; kind of sportscar made in the mid-2000s, the Chrysler Crossfire should be on your list.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

With a lot of expenditure on making Supercars, companies also have to take care with the <strong>BRAND IMAGING</strong>. But no one handles this as superior as Ferrari. The best example to quote this is the worth Fiat lost when it split with Ferrari. Almost an enigma, the story of Ferrari, has lot many key changes in approach and product releases, which are a part of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">irrevocable beauty Ferrari stands for</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>Well, a very comprehensive glimpse through the market history of the company hints you to the number of exclusive releases for a platform like that of 599, F430, 458, California and many more. <a href=\"https://www.ferrari.com/en_in/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari</a> outshines by achieving &pound;552m in revenues with exports of just over 7200 units, which have a value much higher than Masseratis&#39;, which in reality, exports about 36000 cars annually!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This not only aids Ferrari to invest in Motorsports activities, but also helps gain revenue out of licensing. But the crux of this massive brand remains at the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>POWER OF THE WHEELS</em></span></strong>. And Ferrari is in no mood to add electric cars, which reassures us about its approach to move on with the exclusivity, the company stands for. The recent Berlenitas, Aperta and Speciale models on the FF and 458 Italia have the most captivating rides possible. Let&#39;s have a brief view over the models that are exclusive on rides but are even captivating on sights!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>F430 Spider</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"F430 Spider\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/ferrari-f430-wall.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.uhdwallpapers.org</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Horses menacing around your street can be an issue, but the feeling when 490 horses prance together under a convertible body, is one in a lifetime.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key launches of 2005, Ferrari added history to the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari/f430\">F430 lineup</a> with this.

This car has to be tamed and then enjoyed, a very different machine indeed!&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There might be many track-based cars launched every year with lots of high-tech used to make it sharper and agile, but the phenomenal cruising ability at lower RPMs delights every driver. And with such technology at hand, it is <strong>INEVITABLE</strong> for every auto enthusiast to look forward at every new launch. This year too, Ferrari is expected to come up with new versions on the 488 platform but what about India? That is something that Delhi Auto Expo 16 will answer! Stay tuned!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

It&#39;s the quintessential definition of a luxury minivan. While Chrysler is famous for its big brute sedans such as the 300C in America, in far reaches of Europe and Mexico, the Chrysler brand is mostly synonymous with practical and luxury minivans. In fact, the Chrysler Grand Voyager was sold exclusively in these regions, before going on sale in North American markets in later years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Voyager#First_generation_.281988.E2.80.931990.29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">birth of the Grand Voyager</a> dates back to 1988 when Chrysler introduced the Voyager minivan in Europe. The Voyager was actually a rebadged version of the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager that were sold only in the United States that time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Since its inception, the Voyager has evolved and is sold in different countries under different brand names. Despite of its various nameplates, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the Chrysler minivan has been ranked as the 13th bestselling automotive model worldwide, with more than 12 million units sold.</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the Voyager has been renamed as Grand Voyager and is mainly sold in the European as well as North American markets. The company produces the Grand Voyager at its plant in Ontario, Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Grand Voyager is the fifth-gen model in the Voyager series and was built from the ground-up upon its launch in 2008. With the Grand Voyager, Chrysler wanted to target affluent consumers looking for a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/muv-mpv\">luxury multi-purpose vehicle (MUV)</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In essence, the Grand Voyager looked much like the Chrysler Town &amp; Country sold in the North American and South American markets. However, unlike the America-spec version, the Grand Voyager was sold standard with a diesel engine in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Engines</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\".8-litre CRD I4 diesel engine \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/engine-04.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.caradvice.com.au/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The 2008 Chrysler was powered by a 2.8-litre CRD I4 diesel engine that develops 163bhp at 3,800rpm and a peak-torque of 359N-m at 1,600rpm.</em> In 2009, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/chrysler\">Chrysler</a> revealed the diesel motor that has a combined fuel economy of 9.3L/100kms, which is quite impressive, given its size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further up in the range, the 2008-2010 models came fitted with a 3.8-litre V6 petrol that delivered 197bhp of power at 5,200rpm and 312N-m of torque at 4,000rpm. Year 2010 onwards, models were also offered with a 3.6-litre Pentastar V6 petrol, developing 283bhp at 6,600rpm and 353N-m at 4,800rpm. All the models were offered with a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>All the Grand Voyagers sold in Europe from 2011 were badged as Lancia due to Chrysler-Lancia integration. In United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, and China, all the models are sold under Chrysler badge only since Lancia does not operate in these markets.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lancia derivative of the luxury minivan comes fitted with Euro V engine option comprising a 3.6-litre Pentastar V6 petrol that produces 279bhp of max power and 344N-m of peak torque. <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The diesel version comes powered by a 2.8-litre diesel inline 4-engine, which is good enough for producing a peak power and torque of 161bhp and 360Nm, respectively.</span></em> Again, all these variants too come paired with a 6-speed automatic gearbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Features and Equipment</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Chrysler Grand Voyager Features and Equipment\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Features-and-Equipment-04.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.caradvice.com.au/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main USPs of the Chrysler Grand Voyager is the cabin space and equipment it comes loaded with. The Grand Voyager can seat 7 adults including with their complete holiday luggage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>3-zone air-conditioning, rear parking sensors, child-compatible seats, power tailgate, cruise control, auto-leveling rear suspension et al, are some of the features that were standard in the vehicle.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The higher models come with a 6.5-inch touchscreen and are loaded with features such as 40GB hard drive, satellite navigation, 9-speaker stereo with Bluetooth connectivity and 7.1 surround sound, a reversing camera, a DVD player, 17-inch alloy wheels, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some limited models were also offered with rain-sensing wipers, leather seats, automatic leveling HID headlights, eight-way power adjustable and heated front seats, heated second-row seats, chrome exterior highlights, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>The main highlight is its unique Stow&#39;n Go seat configuration though. This arrangement includes two independent second-row seats and a 60:40 split-fold rear bench. The second row seats can be folded manually forward flat into the floor, freeing up to 934-litre of boot space! </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right-hand drive models of the minivan had the gear shift lever placed on a floor-mounted console between the seats as opposed to the instrument panel positioning found on LHD models.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Safety</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler Grand Voyager came fitted with six airbags (driver, passenger, curtain and front side) as standard. Additional safety systems include stability control and ABS. <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The 2011 Lancia version of the car has been awarded four out of five stars in EuroNCAP crash tests.</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grand Voyager sold between 2008 and 2011 were imported in Europe from Canada. However, after 2011, the models got rebadged as Lancia Voyager in most European markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler Grand Voyager is one of the most popular multi-utility vehicles in the world. While other MPVs are made for a single purpose, the Chrysler Grand Voyager offered a lot more to buyers. Its luxurious cabin fitted with a raft of creature comfort features and equipment is a delight to occupants, whereas its exterior exudes elegance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>Finding a used Chrysler Grand Voyager in good nick shouldn&#39;t be a problem in India, since it was sold in millions worldwide and a few good examples were also shipped into the country, albeit through importers and not officially.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luxury car buyers looking for a spacious, unique and quite practical wagon should not be looking elsewhere since the Chrysler Grand Voyager offers so much as a package. If you have the means, and require something similar, there&#39;s no reason to hold back now&hellip;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

This beast will make you think that BMW has made some kind of super coupe with multiple personality traits in a single package &ndash; and to tell you the truth, you will not be much far off from the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it was introduced first in the market in 2008, people did not accept it wholeheartedly instantly and there were a lot of criticism for the shape from many quarters. <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">But the sales chart told another story &ndash; though a bit quirky looking, people did warm up to the idea and eventually, BMW sold a solid 250,000 units of first gen M6</span></em></strong> and gave more than enough reasons for BMW not only to <a href=\"https://www.bmw.in/en/all-models/x-series/X6/2014/start.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">introduce the second generation of X6</a>, but to extent this treatment to X4 (coupe version of X3) and yet to be launched X2 (coupe version of X1).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Changes Galore</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The second generation X6 is longer than the outgoing model by 34mm and wider and taller by 4mm and 12mm, respectively. But the generous use of weight saving materials has helped BMW to shave off almost 40kgs of weight when compared to the previous generation X6. Though the X6 shares the platform with X5, the former gets a <strong><em>slopping roofline &agrave; la coupe</em></strong>. The design cues are now shared with the recently launched X4, and are updated to bring the X6 to the new family looks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The front end is dominated by the sporty and huge double kidney grills and air intakes. The grill and headlamps are wider than the outgoing model, and these, along with the striking air dams, give the car a <strong><em>SPORTY AND AGGRESSIVE LOOK</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The bumper is redesigned to give some sportiness to the character of the vehicle. The width of the vehicle ensured a wide and imposing placement for the headlights and fog lamps and this, along with the redesigned bumper, helps to give the car a good road presence. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car has subtle chrome accents around the windows and this with the tapering roofline and striking crease lines (one extending from the front wheel housing to the rear door handles and the other, from rear wheel housing to the rear of the X6) give the car a striking balance of pose and an unmistakable silhouette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The headlights have adaptive LED lighting and the fog lights and tail lamps are LED, depending on the trim. The adaptive LED headlights come with anti-dazzle high beam assist (which is called <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/mseries/x6m/2014/showroom/driver_assistance/bmw_selective_beam.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BMW selective Beam</a>), variable light control and cornering lights, and automatically adjusts according to the speed and steering angle to ensure that the driver has perfect visibility under all circumstances.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interior</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW X6 Interior\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Interior13.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://cdn.bmwblog.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior has seen a lot of changes and now conforms to the family design.

The interior is clad with high quality materials and premium leather and has the options to customize it according to your taste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The car comes with LED ambient lighting and includes 9 pre-defined lighting patterns in three colors (blue, white and orange), in addition to the &#39;WELCOME&#39; mood. The ambient lighting has LEDs in the head liner, the front and the rear foot wells, the front seat back rests and on all the door compartments and panels, giving the car the look and feel of a lounge. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\">The X6 comes with the latest <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/x6/x6/2007/allfacts/ergonomics/idrive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">iDrive</a> and has paddle shifters to change the gears manually.

If you have the key in your pocket, you can open all the doors and start the engine by pushing the start-stop button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hood features contactless opening (depending upon the package and trim), which helps you to open and close the boot of your car simply by quickly waving your foot under the rear bumper. It is helpful in case when your hands are full of stuff and you can&#39;t use them to open or shut the boot.

Suave and sturdy vehicle carrying the power of a raging bull and supporting its sporty heart and bejeweled looks; the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini/gallardo\">Lamborghini Gallardo</a> is no wonder the most popular Lamborghini and the highest selling one too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of this century, the German automobile manufacturer, Volkswagen, was developing a dream car under the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">flagship brand of Lamborghini</a>. Finally, in 2000, it rolled the dice for this concept car under name &quot;Lamborghini Gallardo&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>Packed with the right amount of insanity and oomph factor, the Gallardo has become the unmatched king of the Lamborghini crown.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fiery EXTERIORS with Cozy INTERIORS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Open roads are waiting for this raging bulls and the comfortable cabin with adjustable equipment settings is here to make your sporty ride a cozy ride as well. It is a sports car captured in the attire of swanky exteriors to support aerodynamics when you are flying in the top gear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>Rear wheel drive supports the powerful sports car&#39;s throaty V10 Engine, supported by front axle. This car moves on a steady pace and gives you feather control on the steering.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine has to get a special mention here since it is the base on which Lamborghini later developed the V12 beasts under the flagship Lamborghinis. <span class=\"redText\">The 5.2-litre V10 under the Gallardo is still no slouch as it pumps out impressive figures of 405kW of power and 540Nm of torque</span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>E-gears in the First Generation</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"First Generation of Lamborghini Gallardo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/E-gears-in-the-first-generation.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.magic4walls.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Lamborghini Gallardo was ahead of its time in 2003 when this series was introduced, where the Electronic gears clubbed together with Semi-automatic Robotized manual. Experts at <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/home/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lamborghini</a> gave it the name of E-gear. This designed was based upon a <strong>Prototype of Cala (1995), Italdesign Giugiaro</strong>. The working of this system was really simple and was accessible with the switch of a button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gears would work in an automatic transmission system but there were paddle shifters provided on the steering of the car, giving the user the feel of the manual gearing whenever he/she wished for it. This system introduced back in 2003 set the Lamborghini apart from the rest of the competition, which in itself was very limited back in the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Faster Car CONVERTED into a MUCH FASTER One in 2005</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Great designs are the ones that keep on improving with the passage of time. The Lamborghini Gallardo kept on changing the specifications with continuous upgrades over the years. During 2005, this car moved into its second generation with an increase in engine power. Lowering of the gearing also added smoothness in the operations and gave the car better acceleration and grunt, but still kept the top speed as it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>This improved sports star was also a little quite in the terms of engine noise and improved the sound levels of the cabins considerably. Lamborghini used its own little piece of technology to make sure that the car remained quiet in the cities but had the ability to roar when required.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reduced Weight &amp; Shift in GEARS to Support the POWER of the Engine</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini Gallardo in 2006\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Reduced-weight-and-shift-in-gears-to-support-the-power-of-the-engine.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.wallpaperup.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>By the arrival of the year 2006, Lamborghini Gallardo launched in a new <strong><em>AVATAR</em></strong> under the flagship name of <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/masterpieces/gallardo/gallardo-lp-570-4-superleggera-edizione-tecnica/overview/#!slide/3998\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gallardo Superleggera</a>. This time, the company did some remarkable changes in the design and brought the weight down by almost 100kgs. Automatic reviewing mirror was installed in the car and Engine power was increased to 530PS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now there are more than 13,000 Lamborghini Gallardos on the road. During its journey of more than a decade, many special editions were launched and with each edition, it did a considerable amount of changes in the exterior and interior of the car to keep its freshness alive. The production of Gallardo Superleggera was called off in 2007 and a new series of Gallardo cars replaced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gallardo LP 560-4 HERALDED a New ERA of Youthfulness in Gallardo Series</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Gallardo LP 560-4\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Gallardo-LP-560-4-heralded.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.wallpaperup.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The engine became more powerful, it was 560PS at an RPM of 8000. Colors of the car also started breathing with a fresh air. With this speed, Lamborghini added safety in measures by introducing <strong><em>&quot;Thrust mode launch control System&quot;</em></strong>. Direct fuel injection system was introduced to support the fuel efficiency and the speedometer started reading the count of 325 kilometers per hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>Lamborghini Gallardo series is amongst the most successful sports &quot;Concept Car&quot; category. After achieving the highest engine power, it kept on improving this car further and introduced more than 15 limited editions. As it is a part of Lamborghini culture, the firm kept on reducing the weight of this car and made some necessary amendments to meet the local needs of various countries where it was supplying all these limited editions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Gallardo in total has 5 updated versions since the original launch as follows:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"listblog\">\r\n\t<li><strong><em>LP 560-4 Spyder</em></strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>LP 570-4 Superleggera</em></strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>LP 570-4 Spyder Performante</em></strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>LP 550-2 Coup&eacute;, LP 550-2 AD</em></strong></li>\r\n\t<li><strong><em>LP 550-2 Spyder</em></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And if that was not enough, the car got 17 limited and special editions. Currently the Lamborghini Gallardo is an evolved, tried and tested car that has clocked sales number of more than what the number crunchers at Lamborghini might be baffled about. With an appeal to enamor the sporty speedster, tuxedo-clad sophisticated hunks and aristocratic corporate citizens seeking a makeover to express their style statement with a fresh new youthful vigor, the Lamborghini Gallardo is really the car for them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it is not the <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/models/aventador-lp-700-4/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Aventador</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini/murcielago\">Murcielago</a> to be a flagship but this car was actually very close to heart to those who breathe cars. Sadly the production of the Lamborghini Gallardo has been stopped and it has been replaced by the much able <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/rear-wheel-drive-lamborghini-huracan-now-available-in-india\">Lamborghini Huracan</a> and we are sure it too can keep with the <strong><em>great repute</em></strong> of the Lamborghini Gallardo.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>It is not every day that you come across a car so devilish that even the Devil might be put to shame. No wonder it was used as an Antagonist in the movie &quot;<em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em>.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when someone makes a car this bad that it is too good, what do they do with it? They make this the succeeding flagship of the <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/home/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">company</a> and that is the same reason why the Aventador is the current flagship of the Lamborghini lineup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>So let&#39;s get on and check out the car as to what makes it so special, shall we?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Body and Design:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the car and you will find it really hard to differentiate between <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">all the Lamborghini cars</a> out on the road right now because the basic design philosophy is pretty much similar with some minor changes here and there. The Aventador is also an amazing piece of beauty made majorly out of Carbon fiber to keep the body weight low and give the car an astounding <strong class=\"darkText\"><em>Body to Weight Ratio</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The main frame of the car is made of Aluminum though to give it more sturdiness. The Aventador also gets heated external mirrors that are electronically controlled completely and the heating keeps fogginess off the mirrors. Also the Aventador gets multiple air inlets, aluminum body parts and most importantly a 3-way adjustable rear spoiler.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suspension setup on the car is a front and rear mono-tube damper with push rod system. This setup is ideal for the Lamborghini because it has low ground clearance and hence this helps keep the car stable and not wobble even at high speeds. This also makes sure that the car has near to zero body roll in high speed cornering and most importantly it also protects this <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">luxuriously premium car</a> well in bumps and potholes that are in plenty on Indian roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Performance Aspects:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Lamborghini Aventador\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/engine15.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.moibbk.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em><a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/models/aventador-lp-700-4/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Lamborghini Aventador</a> comes with the 6.5-litre V12 which is a staple for the Lamborghini flagship since the days of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini/murcielago\">Murcielago</a>. The engine has a 60 degree V angle to allow the powertrain&#39;s better performance. It does churn out some really monstrous figures of 700HP at 8250RPM and 690Nm of Torque at 5500RPM. And with all this at a compression ratio of 11.8:1; still the car is Euro 6 Level 2 complaint.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with such a big car, engine cooling needs to be spot on for which Lamborghini has incorporated both Air and Oil cooling for the engine along with Variable Air Inlets to cool the engine efficiently and kept the performance standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of the transmission the Aventador gets the famous Lamborghini Haldex generation IV E-gear system, which is actually a 7-speed AMT system that can act as a fully automatic or a manual transmission depending on the driver discretion and also the gear shifting patterns are also variable according to the drive mode selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some Amazing Facts:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>No wonder the Aventador is an <strong>amazing supercar</strong> because it can go from 0-100kmph in a measly 2.9 seconds. That is less time for a person to gulp down a glass of water. And if that was not all, it can do 0-200kmph in 8.2 seconds and can reach a top whack of 350kmph. So if you want to go out for some awesome track days to try and better the track record, it is a no brainer really to go for the Aventador.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of fuel capacities, the Aventador gets a 90-litre fuel tank that actually looks quite big but in real the performance is such that the car gets a hit on the fuel efficiency, but still this should be good enough to give the car about 400-500kms range on a full tank.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Features:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Lamborghini Aventador Features\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Features15.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lamborghini Aventador is an awesomely balanced car. The engine of the car is located at the rear and not at the front like it usually is. That has been taken care for a number of reasons really as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"listblog dimText\">\r\n\t<li><em>To provide better rear wheel drive and all-wheel drive and reduce the power loss in transmission from the front of the engine to the rear.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em>To protect the engine&#39;s better, in case of a crash; since it is a fast car and the chances of head on collisions are also ripe.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em>To give the car better turning stability, since the weight up-front would mean difficulty swerving the car at high speeds.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em>To make the entire engine, gearbox and the whole unit as much compact as possible.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em>To keep the NVH levels to a minimum.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This location of the engine on the rear is also the reason for a 43-57 kilograms weight distribution of the car. Also the car comes fitted with Pirelli rubber that is the stickiest out there till date, which means you do not have to worry much about the car dancing on the tarmac anytime. Just that the life of the tyres is pretty limited due to the high performance nature of the car, you need to be wary of them and get them replaced in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safety-wise, the car is also the best in class with airbags fitted all around the cabin along with some specialized airbags. There are front dual stage airbags for the driver along with front adaptive passenger airbag. The seats also get side head-thorax airbags and there are knee airbags for the driver as well. Along with it, the brakes are also well equipped with Dual Hydraulic circuit brakes that are 6-cylinder 4-piston caliper equipped discs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>So the Lamborghini Aventador is the unmatched Lamborghini yet. There are other supercars but even then the charm of the Fighting bull in the current flagship is something to die for. It is the best mix of performance and looks and that&#39;s what we all want right? </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">\"It has been a repeated process of locking horns, asking questions, finding solutions by stepping out of our comfort zones, and moving forward\"</em>, said Shuichi Ozaki, a Lexus Meister who played a decisive role in developing the Lexus cars.</p>\r\n<p>What does it tell you? There's no denying that Lexus's obsession with detail has clearly led <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/LS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LS series</a> to where it is right now. Reminding and re-reminding that this is LS, the mastermind behind this star-studded innovation never compromised on anything.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus_LS#1989.E2.80.931992\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lexus LS400's history</a></em> is extraordinarily interesting and a perfect union of genius brains, expert hands and determination to create dreamlike machinery. Let us tell you the startling story of how and when LS400 started ruling the automobile industry and became one of 'THE' most desired cars of the <em><strong>'MAN OF TASTE'</strong></em>.</p>\r\n<h2>A Question that led to 'THE MAKING OF A LEGEND'</h2>\r\n<p><em><strong>\"Can we create a four-door luxury car to challenge the very best?\"</strong></em> asked Eiji Toyoda, the then chairman of Toyota.</p>\r\n<p>He imposed this simple question without even realizing that one day the answer of this question would make Lexus rule the road and everyone's heart as well.</p>\r\n<p>So many factors contributed to the success of this ambitious project, however, Brian Long, a professional writer with a passion for vintage and sporting cars, nicely pointed out one BIG reason in his <strong>BOOK LEXUS: <em>The Challenge to Create the Finest Automobile, \"Each team had been given the task of identifying the manufacturer who led its field of expertise, analyze why it was the best, and then beat it. There was no time limit imposed and, with the usual constraint of having to use common components taken away, the innovative Lexus engineers were in their element.\"</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes! Complete 'creative freedom' was the key to find answer to the question asked by <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiji_Toyoda\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Eiji Toyoda</a></strong>. The team was offered no budget and no time constraint in order to create that little more than '<strong><em>special</em></strong>' challenger.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>For the span of 6 years, 60 designers, 1400 engineers and around 2300 technicians worked day and night, put their heart, soul and blood to create luxury on four wheels and named it LS400. </em></p>\r\n<h2>Why LS400?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"LS400\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus_ls4002.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.mad4wheels.com</span></div>\r\n<p>In 1983, when the company was in dire need of a full-fledged luxurious car to compete with the '<strong><em>German Giants</em></strong>' like <a href=\"/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a>, <a href=\"/bmw\">BMW</a> and <a href=\"/jaguar\">Jaguar</a>, Lexus left no stone unturned to bring out a world-class high-performance stellar in the market.</p>\r\n<p>Since Toyota used to make small economical cars back then, it was losing lots of customers to its competitors due to a lack of larger luxurious models. Therefore, LS400 was definitely a problem solver for the company and ultimately became its '<strong class=\"darkText\"><em>symbol of finesse</em></strong>'.</p>\r\n<h2>The Mighty LOGO</h2>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>Toyota started its project under the name '<strong>Flagship 1</strong>' or '<strong>F1</strong>', also known as '<strong>Circle-F</strong>' because of the logo (the capital letter F within a circle). Originally, the team got into a trap of creating run-of-the-mill sports-oriented car with big pop-up headlights and a slanting nose, however the company realized that it was about to create a car without that 'extra' special attribute. Soon enough it brought back its traditional vibes out on the floor and agreed upon giving its customers a classy model with a large grille. </em></p>\r\n<p>The very first prototype came in 1985 and by 1986, a full-on road testing began, which made Toyota think of launching this new model under separate brand in the markets of the USA and Europe. The automaker wanted its customers to believe in not just the superiority and opulence of this model but also to feel its authoritative characteristic while driving.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, the name '<a href=\"/lexus\"><strong>LEXUS</strong></a>' was born, a pseudo-Latin name clearly describing company's intention and ambition, which eventually changed the 'F' within the circle into 'L'. Hence, the famous Lexus logo came into existence.</p>\r\n<h2>The LEGEND was BORN</h2>\r\n<p>Years 1987 and 1988 were very crucial for the company. After successful completion of the phases of the final design and patents, in 1989, <em class=\"redText\"><strong>LS400 made its official debut at the Detroit Motor Show.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>After an overwhelming applause in the USA; by 1990 LS400 was all set to rule the markets of the Australia and European countries and this kind of huge response was pretty much expected by the company. It outdid the <a href=\"/collection\">other cars of the same 'luxurious' segment</a> in terms of sales and became a real threat to all the established brands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\">LS400 was totally different from the other Toyota models (it ought to be, after all it was 'SPECIAL'). The Non-glossy Lexus LS series had its own identity. Distinctive and first-rate parts, sandwich steel body and immaculate design touches like no wind noise windows and flush door handles, LS400 proved to be a technological '<strong>CHEF-D'OEUVRE</strong>'.</p>\r\n<h2>Legends NEVER Tread the Path, they CREATE their Own!</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Interiors of Lexus LS400\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus_ls400_interiar.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://upload.wikimedia.org</span></div>\r\n<p>Have you ever seen legends following others? <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lexus truly showed the world that it takes time, sweat and blood to a create masterpiece</span>. By introducing a host of innovative and high-tech features in its first luxurious car, Lexus unquestionably created a perfect contender to take the German models on. The following features were way technologically advanced:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listblog\">\r\n<li>Holographic</li>\r\n<li>Electro-luminescent gauges</li>\r\n<li>Electric memory seating</li>\r\n<li>Electro-chromic rear-view mirro</li>\r\n<li>Fluid-damped switchgear</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em>LS400 was a powerful machine of its time. Powered by a 4.0-litre V8 engine, LS400 promised to pump out 254bhp and was flying at 160mph. LS400's extraordinary performance was one of a kind, which blew everyone's mind. It was modern, refined and powerful and people loved it and wanted to possess it. After all, they got a better alternative and could graduate to true 'LUXURY'. </em></p>\r\n<h2>25 Years and Still RULING</h2>\r\n<p>It has been more than 25 years and LS400 is still <a href=\"/blog/its-official-lexus-ls-isking-of-the-road\">the company's best car</a>. The first-generation LS has been a prototype for Lexus's other models. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>After LS400, the company grew by leaps and bounds and became a global leader with a growing range of luxurious sedans, coupes and even SUVs.</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"darkText\">Today, the company might be boasting 8 different models including the finest LFA, however, the name Lexus started with just one car i.e. LS400.</p>\r\n<p>Well, it won't completely be wrong to say that LS400 was self-sufficient and didn't need anything or any logo to become a heart-stealer (that's what you call true craftsmanship), but Lexus does owe its stardom and a huge fan base to its primitive and credible experiment of LS400.</p>\r\n</div>",

It is this car that took the Lamborghini flagship to new heights and it was this car that made the flagship bigger, better and faster.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The Murcielago was literally the flagship to transition from the old Lamborghini to the new with new styling cues, multiple engine updates and addition of new technology to the car.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Beginning of THE Flagship:</h2>\r\n<p>The Murcielago was introduced back in 2001, which seems like such a long time today. But back then, it was the car that has shaped the way <a href=\"/lamborghini\">Lamborghinis look today</a> because back then it was a revolution in the design of the Murcielago. Previous flagship from Lamborghini; <strong>DIABLO</strong> also did very well as a flagship, but it was time for change since there were a lot of changes going on in Lamborghini.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\">For starters, the design of the Murcielago was a fresh welcome change since it was the first change in the design for a Lamborghini car in 11 years. Now that is over a decade. Secondly the car was the first to be developed under the new management of Audi, which is a Volkswagen owned brand. This is the reason why the Murcielago is so important.</p>\r\n<p>Not only is the car a true icon but it is the proof that <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">even under the new ownership, the car has not lost touch with its roots and even the new management left no stone unturned to make sure that the car stayed true to its Lamborghini origin</span></em>. This was also the first flagship to actually get a complete engine makeover in its lifetime and not an update or retuning of the engine.</p>\r\n<h2>Under the Hood:</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini Murcielago \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lamborghini1.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.zastavki.com/</span></div>\r\n<p>We all know that the <a href=\"/lamborghini/murcielago\">Lamborghini Murcielago</a> is one car that is an amazing looker with the Angular cut quadrilateral headlamps and the scissor doors. <strong>But what really was special about this car is its engine</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>When launched, the Murcielago had received the 6.2-litre V12 engine that produced 575HP of maximum power and was also starred in the movie <em><strong class=\"redText\">Batman Begins</strong></em>.</p>\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">But the main fun arrived when this engine was bumped up to a 6.5-litre V12, which was the start for this engine being used in Lamborghini flagships</em>. The powertrain churned out 640HP power and an impressive amount of torque pull. This was also the car that first had manual transmission on it and later received the E-gear package to it making it a true luxury cum performance machine.</p>\r\n<p>Later with years to come by, the engine of the car received tuning updated where the power of the car was increased from 640 to 650 HP and later to 670 HP, which was really impressive. The final iteration of the car finally made to the 3 second mark and the last edition, <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/masterpieces/murcielago/murcielago-lp-670-super-veloce/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Murcielago SuperVeloce</a>, was the one to breach 0-100 kmph in 2.8 seconds</p>\r\n<h2>Performance and Features:</h2>\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Murcielago was the epitome of performance from Lamborghini</span></em></strong> back then, as it was the first Lamborghini to be fitted with so many performance parts and lots of electronics to go along with it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\">It was a car that could do 300kmph of top thwack and also run speeds quite quickly. The second iteration of the car, which was a roadster, has a convertible top and there the company even put out a warning on the windscreen for the driver to not cross 100 miles per hour with the top up.</p>\r\n<p>Other than that the car got the E-gear system that allowed the driver to switch the car to automatic when needed and if he wanted the manual transmission, he could shift the gears using paddle shifters located at the back of the steering wheel.</p>\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Also the Murcielago had the electromechanically controlled rear spoiler, which came into effect only when the car reaches high speeds, so as to provide better performance and aid in the cooling of the engine too.</span></em></p>\r\n<p>The engine was located in the rear of the car and was provided with water and oil cooling along with multiple air inlets. The rear location did help in the performance of the car by making it more nimble and hence could attack corners really well. <strong>This even allowed the car to be capable of participation in Motorsports</strong>.</p>\r\n<h2>Motorsports Participation:</h2>\r\n<p>The Lamborghini Murcielago with its V12 6.5-litre producing 670HP of power was the car of choice for many to take part in motorsports. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Murcielago R-GT was a limited edition track only version and only 9 units of them were made to comply with the regulations</span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>It entered a lot of tournaments and won various races but sadly it was not classified in the <strong>24 HOURS OF LE MANS</strong>, which if possible could have had been a huge thing for Lamborghini as a whole.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Limited Editions:</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini Murcielago Limited Editions\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/ENGINE150.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: www.moibbk.co</span></div>\r\n<p>The Murcielago underwent about <strong>5 FACELIFTS</strong> and updates in its lifetime as follows:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listblog\">\r\n<li><em>Murcielago</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Murcielago Roadster</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Murcielago LP 640</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Murcielago LP 640 Roadster</em></li>\r\n<li><em>Murcielago LP 670&ndash;4 SuperVeloce</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Apart from this the car also received numerous <strong>LIMITED EDITIONS</strong> too as follows:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"listblog\">\r\n<li><em>40th Anniversary Edition</em></li>\r\n<li><em>LP 640 Versace</em></li>\r\n<li><em>LP 650&ndash;4 Roadster</em></li>\r\n<li><em>LP 670&ndash;4 SuperVeloce China Limited Edition</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There were a lot of reports previously that the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lamborghini cars were catching on fire and due to which the company recalled about 428 of its cars</span> for a suspected fuel pump issues that could cause a leak in fuel and hence lead to catch fire. But the problem is now reported to be sorted out.</p>\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>The Lamborghini Murcielago is quite an iconic car for the company and it has done really well, giving justice to it being the flagship Lamborghini. There are 4099 Murcielago sold across the globe through its lifetime across various editions and updates and ultimately the car was succeeded by the Aventador in 2011. </em></p>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\"><!--<div class=\"blogImg\"><span class=\"imgRef\">Source: LavishBuck.com</span></div>-->\r\n<p>Over the years the punjabi music industry has remoulded and changed drastically. The earlier famous &#39;Mundeys&#39; doing bhangra in sugarcane fields have changed to &#39;Jatts&#39; partying in a yatch or strolling on the streets of New york. Words like Gabru have been changed to Swag and with more of rap specially in hinglish. The entire look, feel and sound of Punjabi music has been revolutionised in less than a decade. But one common feature of almost every Punjabi song these days, though astonishing and very impressive, is the use of flashy <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a>. And We being luxury car fanatic couldn&#39;t help noticing that all the videos have the singer driving either an Audi or a Lamborghini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a list of the all time famous Punjabi hits that have featured beautiful supercars which would make you sing and swoon all day all night;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Blue Eyes</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Blue Eyes\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/because_singh_is_bling_blue_eyes.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Blue Eyes, T-Series</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest hits of that year, Honey Singh with much criticism got tremendous fame. His hip hop dance, his swagger look everything worked out well with the song BUT for supercar fanatics like us, the show stopper was the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini/gallardo\">Lamborghini Gallardo</a>. The girl starring was surely pretty but if you look from the eyes of a supercar lover - the Lamborghini looked like the real bomb - <strong class=\"redText\"><em>Lamborghini bomb lagdi mainu.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Desi Kalakaar</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Desi Kalakaar\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/because_singh_is_bling_desi_kalakaar.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Desi Kalakaar, T-Series</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;re probably reaching to the conclusion that we love Honey Singh. Sure we do! But as much as we love him, we love love the black muscle he drives in the video. It is none other than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_GTO\" target=\"_blank\">Pontiac GTO</a>. Heartbeats stop for seconds when this dark beauty appears on the screen. Extra points to Desi Kalakaar are given for the fascinating car chase scene in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Proper Patola</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Proper Patola\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/because_singh_is_bling_proper_patola.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Proper Patola, SonyMusicIndiaVEVO</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Diljit Dosanjh is always known for coming up with groovy R&amp;B. The entire feel and the look of the song is a class apart. But as soon as the red hot Chevy Impala (Yes that is the car if you were wondering) in the video, one would want to pause and stare for as long as possible. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Totally steals the show Chevy!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vroom Vroom</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Vroom Vroom\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/because_singh_is_bling_vroom_vroom.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one treat for the eyes! You name it they have featured it. Shot exclusively in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">Big Boy Toyz showroom</a>, one gets to lay their eyes upon any and every luxury car brand that one can think about. Be it Porsche or Rolls Royce or for that matter Bentley, every supercar that one has dreamt about can be seen in a single video. After this video, definitely your heart will go <strong class=\"redText\"><em>vroom vroom!</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jaguar</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jaguar\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/because_singh_is_bling_jaguar.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Jaguar, Speed Records</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes the famous <a href=\"https://www.jaguar.in/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jaguar</a> song Ft Bohemia (after a long time). Of course it had to feature in this list; A superhit song with a supercar. The entire song is centered around Jaguar. Well one wouldn&#39;t really blame the <em>Kudi</em> for saying &#39; <strong class=\"redText\"><em>pehle Jaguar le lao</em></strong>&#39;. After all If you don&#39;t own a Jaguar, you don&#39;t own a JAGUAR!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chaar Chudiya</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Chaar Churiyaan\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/because_singh_is_bling_chaar_chudiyaan.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Chaar Churiyaan, Speed Records</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The last but not the least we have the latest Badshah song Chaar Chudiya. Another bizarre yet entertaining song centered around Audi. In the entire video the guy hopes to get an Audi (we don&#39;t blame him) to impress a girl. Then Baam! there is a dream sequence which feature a Red <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/r8\">Audi R8 convertible</a>, sponsored by Big Boy Toyz, which is the cherry on this cake. Once you see it - you cannot stop dreaming about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong class=\"redText\">One definitely falls for these amazing punjabi songs since they obviously have so much more than groovy beats on which one could dance on the weddings.</strong></em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

It is the only Lamborghini which made it into 5-figure sales figures. Of course, it was Lamborghini itself who made so many units of the car and discontinued to the others sooner, but still it does count to something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hence it becomes more important to check out the Huracan and see what it packs and how it plans to fare in the segment of the affordable of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghinis</a>. The automobile giant definitely has made a lot of improvements in the old technology of the Gallardo, but still will that be enough to get the crowds to the Huracan?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Design and Looks:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lamborghini Huracan is undoubtedly the cleanest and meanest looking Lamborghini till date. Surely the other Lamborghinis might be feeling a bit jealous over the newest member of the family. But as mean it is from the outside, it is from the inside as well. It gets all the bells and whistles and the toys inside like leather seats, cool dash and a lot more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is something that might even remind you of an airplane, but the way it is made, it does stand true to the name it is given which stands for a &quot;<em><strong class=\"redText\">Hurricane.</strong></em>&quot; But as much as a hurricane it is from the way it looks, it even moves like one, disturbing the air around it with huge amount of power. The body of the car is made majorly of aluminum composite material and the frame is a hybrid aluminum and carbon fiber unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Engine and Performance:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Huracan gets the 5.2-litre V10 engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lamborghini-engine-and-performance.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em>The Huracan gets the 5.2-litre V10 engine that churns out 602HP of power. The car even with the smaller engine is still capable of good speeds as it tops out at 325kmph and can still make 0-100kmph in just 3.2 seconds. The engine has a high 12.7:1 compression ratio and gets both water and oil cooling system to keep it calm and stable.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the suspension front, the Huracan gets an aluminum double-wishbone suspension that is firm and sturdy to hold the car steady, even at high speeds. The transmission duties are done by the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and the car gets an all-wheel drive. The transmission is available only in automatic variant and there is no optional manual more present as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tranny unit is tuned in such a way that it has a differential output depending upon the drive mode selected by the driver. The car gets multiple driving modes that allow the driver the comfort depending upon the road conditions and the mood as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Features:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Huracan gets Pirelli rubber that makes sure the road grip is at the peak. The wheel size and tyre size on the front and rear though are different, which supposedly Lamborghini has tweaked for better performance because other than that it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to give different size front and rear tyres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic;\">Other than that the rest of the features are pretty standard like ABS and ESP program and also there is traction control to keep the car from slipping under high and hard acceleration. The engine is located on the rear of the car, which has been the <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/models/huracan-lp-610-4/technical-specifications/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lamborghini signature</a> since the last some editions of the cars it has been releasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Safety Features:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"dual circuit brakes\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lamborghini-safety-features-of-huracan.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Huracan is no slouch on the road, but then it also packs really well when it comes to safety features. The deadly beast comes equipped with dual circuit brakes that are carbon-ceramic discs. It gets 6-piston calipers on the front and 4-piston calipers on the rear to give the car all the stopping power to keep the car under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>And in case something untoward happens, then there are full size dual stage airbags for both the driver and the passenger accompanied by other lateral airbags to keep the rest of the body parts of the passengers safe.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use in Official Purposes:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Huracan is the Lamborghini incorporated into the Italian Police Force. The company along with the police force has come up with a custom Lamborghini Huracan after its previous two Gallardo were in a crash and hence have been decommissioned. The cars are fitted with the Police communication tools, cameras on the RVMs and the computer system on the rear of the car to record all the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Huracan gets the Italian police livery and stripes and colors. It gets all the state of the art equipment that a police car requires, complete with the lights and siren. So it is a warning to everyone to do not try to run out the Italian Police, they will catch you.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lamborghini Huracan has been launched just recently but till now it has managed to do really well when it comes to sales figures. Till now Lamborghini has sold 2242 units of the Huracan with more to follow. <em>Apparently Lamborghini has claimed that it only plans to produce about 10,000 units of the Huracan and if that is true then we surely will have another Gallardo success for Lamborghini.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong class=\"redText\">So do not let the numbers fool you that it has a smaller engine and hence the car does not fare much when put against the flagship. Remember that when it was put to a track test, the Huracan came out faster than even the <a href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en/models/aventador-lp-700-4/overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Aventador</a>.</strong></em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\"><!--<div class=\"blogImg\"><span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Avtodor.su</span></div>-->\r\n<p>As a matter of fact, <a href=\"https://www.chrysler.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler</a> is mostly known for making <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">luxury sedans</a>, vans and sportscars. Being an American brand it is, though, it was only inevitable for the firm to get into the business of making big-brute SUVs. America&#39;s love for pick-up trucks and SUVs is unmatched and seeing its country&#39;s affinity for these high-riding vehicles, Chrysler decided to enter this segment with the launch of the Aspen SUV in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>The Chrysler Aspen was based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Durango\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dodge Durango</a> and was a full-sized luxury SUV. The Aspen also happens to be the first-truck based SUV that was built and sold under the Chrysler brand name.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aspen could seat 8-people in comfort and came with an all-wheel drive layout so as to take on any terrain, although in a cosseting manner. The main trump card of the Chrysler Aspen was its price tag though. The company claimed that the Aspen offers customers a sophisticated premium SUV for thousands of dollars less than its luxury-priced competitors of that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DESIGN:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Chrysler promoted the Aspen as the 300 (the company&#39;s famous luxury sedan) of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">luxury SUV segment</a>. The design of the SUV was also heavily inspired by the Chrysler 300 sedan while it had a hint of Crossfire coupe in its design lines as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aspen featured a large chrome grille, or the &quot;face&quot; of the Chrysler brand, as the company likes to put it. The vehicle had &quot;<em><strong>Chrysler Wings</strong></em>&quot; too that flow seamlessly into the grille, and come with a gold seal brand logo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SUV looked quite intimidating, you have to admit. It has muscular front and rear fenders with seamless and coherent design. A lot of chrome is also used on the body, like the side moldings, door handles, beltline molding, roof rack, ORVMs, etc. have the chrome finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the 20-inch wheels were chromed, and looked quite gorgeous. If you were a famous rapper of that era, you couldn&#39;t possibly give it a miss!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>INTERIOR, FEATURES &amp; EQUIPMENT:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Chrysler Aspen\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog-chrysler-aspen-Interior-features-and-equipment.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Avtodor.su</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Durango#Chrysler_Aspen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Chrysler Aspen</a> offered everything in abundance to its customers- be it features, space or the equipment in the car. <strong><em style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Aspen came fitted with premium features such as interior LED lighting, express-up front windows, a full-screen navigation radio, heated first and second row seats, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.</em></strong> It also had a one-touch lane-change feature that&#39;d allow the driver to quickly activate a three-blink turn signal when changing lanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cabin was spacious, too. In fact, it was much bigger than any of its rivals. Its multiple seating and cargo configurations meant second and third row seats have ample legroom and shoulder room. When not in use, both rows could be conveniently folded down flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The rear seat occupants also had a flip-down, roof-mounted DVD screen available with a theater-style surround-sound audio system, fitted with 80 Infinity brand speakers. The trunk could be opened electrically, adding to the convenience factor.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safety net on the vehicle included Electronic Stability Program (ESP), ABS, Electronic Roll Mitigation (ERM), rear parking camera and sensors, tyre pressure monitoring system and side-curtain air bags for all three rows in addition to dual front airbags for driver and passenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ENGINE:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"ENGINE\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog-chrysler-aspen-engine.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: Topspeed.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>When Chrysler launched the Aspen, it claimed the latter to have the capabilities and luxury of a full-blown SUV, while it (Aspen) sips fuel like a small SUV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redtext\"><em>The Chrysler Aspen came fitted with a 235bhp producing 4.7-litre V8 petrol engine as standard. Also on offer was a more powerful 5.7-litre HEMI V8 petrol motor. This engine had a rated power output of 335bhp. It also came with Chrysler&#39;s fuel saving MDS (multi-displacement system).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This meant the engine could run on 4-cylinders when there isn&#39;t much load, and can run all 8-cylinders so as to deliver maximum grunt from the HEMI V8. Both 4.7-litre and 5.7-litre V8 powertrains came paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler Aspen was offered with all-wheel-drive electric-shift transfer cases. The 4.7-litre V8 powered version came fitted with a single-speed transfer case to provide all-wheel drive (AWD) and 4-wheel-drive &quot;<em><strong>HIGH</strong></em>&quot; operating modes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 5.7-litre HEMI V8, there was a 2-speed transfer case that featured an all-wheel-drive (AWD) mode and 4-wheel-drive &quot;<em><strong>HIGH</strong></em>&quot; and &quot;<em><strong>LOW</strong></em>&quot; modes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>The Chrysler Aspen was built between 2006 and 2010. Upon its launch, it managed to grab quite a many eyeballs with its design and style while it scored tremendously in terms of practicality.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler Aspen is again one of the rarer SUVs that have come out of America. And because it was a first for Chrysler (in that segment), the car makes it all the more interesting. Getting hold of one could be a <em><strong>HERCULEAN TASK</strong></em> in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">used car market</a> but, it&#39;s not that you won&#39;t find many. In fact, the Dodge Durango on which it is based is an identical car. If you get one of those it&#39;s one or the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>That being said, the Aspen is a little more special because it was not just a part of a new beginning for Chrysler, it&#39;s also a significant part of the history of the brand.</strong></em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The cute little beast debuted in 1959 broke many established rules of the sports car and defined a few of its own, and went ahead to become one of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">most successful sports cars</a> ever made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em><strong>The success and the following of MINI was so high that in 1999, MINI was voted as the second most influential car of 20th century (the first was Ford Model T), trumping other icons like VW Beetle, Porsche 911, Citroen DS, etc.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Bit of History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MINI was designed originally by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Issigonis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sir Alec Issigonis</a> and was manufactured in England, under British Motor Corporation. Though Sir Issigonis envisioned MINI as a car for the common man, his friend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper_%28car_maker%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the tuning legend John Cooper</a> found the potential in MINI to become a sports car and he along with Issigonis created the sports iteration of MINI &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mini/cooper\">the MINI Cooper</a> &ndash; and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>Mini Cooper and Mini Cooper S became rally legends and won almost all the rallies they entered, across the world.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the MINI was acquired by BMW, many skeptics believed that BMW will kill the soul of original MINI and will churn out bloated products &ndash; but to the surprise of many, BMW retained the essential characteristics and reinvented the MINI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car retained the classic design and the iconic bulldog stance, but under the skin, the car had undergone a host of changes and became an amalgam of sporty character and luxury. The MINI retained the front engine, front wheel drive layout and the incredibly direct, go-kart like feeling to drive, though the car has grown both in size and weight, partially to meet new norms and partially to address the new market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Even though the weight of the car was increased, it was offset by addition of much powerful engines, which added to the fun factor of driving the MINI.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exterior</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mini Cooper S\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog_mini_cooper_s_Exterior.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: ambwallpapers.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>One look and you can unmistakably feel the influence of original <a href=\"https://www.mini.in/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MINI</a> on the design of the current generation MINI. The MINI designs are always <em style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EVOLUTIONARY THAN REVOLUTIONARY</em> and works well with the whole retro themed design concept. The longer wheelbase has lent MINI a sleek silhouette, which will be appreciated by many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The car is bigger than the previous MINI &ndash; the new MINI is measured at 3,850mm x 1,727mm x 1,414mm (LxBxH), with the wheelbase at 2,495mm (an increase of 28mm over previous generation), and is based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_UKL_platform\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BMW&#39;s UKL platform</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are not much design changes from the previous generation, the headlamps are redesigned but still have that familiar chrome strip around them, while the projector lights are standard, you can opt for LED headlamps and cornering lights, if you desire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The front is dominated by the imposing single grill with the familiar thick chrome border, and the air intakes are repositioned and redesigned &ndash; now they are bigger and more rectangular and add to the sporty look of the car.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car rides on 16-inch alloys (optional 17-inchers are available) and sports LED tail lights. The new model loses some of the chrome bits surround the reflector and the strip above the number plate are now clad in black instead of chrome. The muscular beauty retains the centrally mounted twin exhaust pipes that are exclusive to Cooper S.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interiors</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Interiors\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog_mini_cooper_s_interior.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: netcarshow.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The cabin and the interiors are finished in premium materials and oozes quality. The cabin extrudes a sporty air and the first thing you will notice is that the instrument console is moved back to the default position &ndash; behind the steering wheel &ndash; from the center mounted position of the previous generation MINI.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The circular theme of previous generation is toned down &ndash; though there is an abundance of circular objects, the designers have used other geometrical forms to break the monotony. The speedometer and tachometer are housed in circular pods that are mounted on steering column, which moves with the steering when you adjust the steering &ndash; <em>neat touch</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The body hugging sport front seats comes with an array of adjustments that will satisfy most of the target audience. The seat is adjustable for height and under thigh support. The cherry on top of the cake &ndash; the steering wheel &ndash; is a meaty unit, feels good to hold and is of perfect size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>It is wrapped in leather and houses switches for cruise control, voice commands, telephone and audio controls. The steering offers reach and rake adjustment. The dashboard is finished in soft touch materials and the quality is top notch. The power window switches are now moved to the conventional position and are positioned on the door pads. All the switchgears are laid out ergonomically and are made out of high quality materials. The center console houses some extremely cool toggle switches (including the one for engine start stop).</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MINI gains a 6.5-inch centrally mounted infotainment system, housed in a circular pod. The multimedia controller is placed low down, usually where you expect to see the handbreak lever. Though not a touchscreen, the unit offers excellent readability and is easy to navigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cabin is bathed in ambient lighting and you can choose from an array of 13 shades. The car can accommodate 4 adults and their luggage with ease now, especially with the bigger cargo area and the 60:40 split seats at rear.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Advanced Features</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The car comes with multiple driving modes &ndash; there is a &#39;<strong style=\"color: #2ca72c;\">GREEN</strong>&#39; mode when you want to pussyfoot around and you are in the mood to burn some rubber, there is the sport mode to aid you. Leaving the selector ring at mid position, let MINI chooses the best mode automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can connect your smartphone to the car and facilitate a host of features &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.mini.com/connectivity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the MINI CONNECT</a> features many apps to make your life on the road easier. The MINI Streetwise allows you to keep a check on your MINI using your smartphone and offers a host of vital information at your fingertips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The central infotainment system houses a navigation unit that has some nifty features like speed limit info, green route option, etc.</em> You can add the optional Heads up Display that projects the details about your journey onto a retractable screen, placed in your field of vision so that you can read all the info without taking eyes off the road. The car also has interactive LEDs that can be programmed to change colors when certain events take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Safety</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>BMW has equipped the MINI with a wide array of passive and active safety features. The car sports driver assist systems like city collision mitigation system, forward collision warning and speed limit info and traffic sign memory that warns you about the change in speed limits. MINI is also equipped with an <em>active pedestrian protection system and a video assisted adaptive cruise control</em>. The headlights feature digital high beam assist that makes night driving effortless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car is loaded with dual front, side, curtain and knee airbags and comes with run flat tyres so that you are never inconvenienced by a puncher.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Engine</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog_mini_cooper_s_Engine.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: netcarshow.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em><a href=\"https://www.mini.in/mini/cooper_s/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Cooper S</a> comes with a turbo charged 2.0-liter petrol engine, which outputs a maximum of 189bhp and 280Nm of power and torque, respectively. <a href=\"https://www.mini.in/mini/cooper_d/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Cooper D</a>, on the other hand, is powered by a 1.5-liter Twin power Turbo diesel unit, which outputs a peak 116bhp and 270Nm of power and torque, respectively.

Your new <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lexus\">Lexus</a> has finally arrived. You sat inside and felt the power to rule the world on your luxurious four wheels. You savored the interior through your eyes, sniffed around and found that the new car smells really intoxicating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>But have you ever thought that how come a new car doesn&#39;t smell like a fish or dumpster, when it consists of so many different materials, adhesives and chemicals?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it is because a highly trained team of &quot;SNIFFERS&quot; works on every part and component to set the right kind of smell for your cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s know some unknown facts about how auto companies create that &quot;new-car-smell&quot; and how efficiently they work behind achieving that &quot;perfect smell&quot; for your cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Companies with a &quot;SMELL TEAM&quot;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know that almost all the big companies have well appointed &quot;smell team&quot; to evaluate smell and then reject or reformulate any unpleasant material?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>This highly trained team of sniffers put their noses on the line to smell different odorous materials like plastics, foams, leather, fabric, carpet, etc. Lexus, Jaguar, Toyota, almost every company has a &quot;smell team&quot; with a very sensitive and unflawed nose.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Effects of Globalization of the Car Market on Smell Tests</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Effects of Globalization of the Car Market on Smell Tests\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog_lexus_new_car_smell_Effects-of-globalization-of-the-car-market-on-smell-tests.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: lexus.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Globalization of the car market makes this task inevitable as well as daunting. Different countries and different cultures have different liking and disliking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, <em class=\"dimText\">Americans are really fussy about &#39;fishy&#39; smells and this powerful country being having a very clean and sanitized environment, it is easy for the Lexus smell team to pick any odor (even fishy smell).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, <em>Japanese have a strong appetite for fishy smells but an unforgivable nose for natural fibers</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One smell could be good for someone and can be problematic for others, depending upon the taste and liking of different people. Best example is <em>LEATHER</em>, which is a tricky one. The Americans and Europeans find leather smells very luxurious and it gives them a sense of richness in the <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/RX\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">car interiors</a>, however, Indian drivers totally detest this smell and are more inclined towards different fabrics (now you know why many drivers deck up their cars with towels).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Process to Test ODOR</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Process to Test ODOR\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog_lexus_new_car_smell_The-process-to-test-odor.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: i.ytimg.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The process to test the car odor is meticulous as well as quiet interesting. To test the car odor, all the car components are heated using big ovens and sniffed in big mason jars. Small chunks of all the car components are stuffed into the jars and then they are heated in the oven to three different temperatures:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"listblog dimText\">\r\n\t<li>73F to create normal room temperature</li>\r\n\t<li>104F with some water to create humid environment</li>\r\n\t<li>176F to create the environment of dry heat.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Different temperature and environment tend to change the smell of the materials. A skillful team of sniffers rates the smells separately, approving good or neutral smell while flagging anything that smells bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, some companies do follow different ways to do the smell test. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/toyota\">Toyota</a>, parent company of Lexus, follows the guidelines set by the Japanese Automotive Manufacturers Association, which caused the company to switch to some lower-emission products in some cases, such as a resin with 80 percent lower formaldehyde emissions. Gradually, companies are switching over to more natural and organic methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cherry-Picked Smell Team</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the right smell team is a critical job to perform! Lexus makes sure that its smell team consists of best of laboratory engineers with sensitive nose for different odors. There is no formal or rigorous training to make a good sniffer; however, the person has to keep couple of things in his/her mind before becoming a part of the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>For instance</strong></em> &ndash; <em>The person is not allowed to smoke or shouldn&#39;t have cold or sinus or any kind of allergies; also that person is not allowed to wear strong perfumes or cologne (might interfere with other odors)</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They NEVER Give Up&hellip;</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"They NEVER Give Up\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog_lexus_new_car_smell_They-never-give-up.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: lexusenthusiast.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If any component fails the smell test, Lexus smell team rejects it and sends that component back to the manufacturer to get reformulated. There are rare occasions when after getting every smell right, a car, during its early production phase, still has some odor left in the interior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>In such cases, smell team is called upon and they sniff the interiors again to narrow down affected area. It doesn&#39;t happen all the time but when it does then the teams make sure that the component is replaced, reformulated and fitted back to get the things right.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is This New Car Smell Good For Your HEALTH?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we know that this powerful smell of a brand new car, which actually feels good and gives us a sense of &#39;<em>NEWNESS</em>&#39;, is created with a lot of chemicals and other factors like glue, paint, carpeting, leather and vinyl sealant, gasoline, and other lubricating compounds. However, so many chemicals together become a hotheaded volcano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>In a research, conducted by <a href=\"https://www.ecocenter.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ecology Center</em></a>, reveals that all these volatile chemicals are hazardous for us. When inhaled or ingested these chemicals can create havoc inside our body; that&#39;s why many biggies like Lexus and <a href=\"https://www.india.ford.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ford</em></a> have taken a path of natural and organic products like water-based glues and usage of soy instead of petroleum-based materials.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, in near future all the auto companies will take the similar safe path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, we would definitely like to salute the sniffers, who work round the clock and <em class=\"redText\">never let you drive a new car with a bad smell</em>. This interesting yet critical job needs to be recognized by all the car lovers.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Whether it&#39;s the model, the architecture, the brand or the history behind it, every brand has won a war of its own and come out like the <em>king of the world</em>. It&#39;s amazing how every inch of any super car has a glorious story behind it and one such aspect is the <strong>LOGO</strong>. Every logo is a like a hidden but famous folk lore. Many interesting stories and events go behind the small emblem.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ferrari</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ferrari LOGO\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/ferrari1-logo.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The famous logo of the black prancing horse goes back to World War I. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Baracca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Count Francesco Baracca</a>, a legendary ace of Italian Air Force who became a national hero after he died very young in 1918, had the same black prancing horse painted on his plane. Enzo Ferrari quotes,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>&quot;The horse was painted on the fuselage of the fighter plane of Francesco Baracca&mdash; a heroic airman of the First World War. In &#39;23, I met count Enrico Baracca, the hero&#39;s father, and then his mother, Countess Paulina, who said to me one day, &#39;Ferrari, put my son&#39;s prancing horse on your cars. It will bring you good luck&#39;. The horse was, and still is, black, and I added the canary yellow background which is the color of Modena.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alfa Romeo</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Alfa Romeo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Alfa-Romeo-logo.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most ancient and most interesting Logo of all times and nevertheless much speculated too. One side is <em>Red Cross on white field</em> which is the symbol of Milan, hometown of <a href=\"https://www.alfaromeousa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Alfa Romeo</a>. And on the other side is the much controversial snake (also speculated as a dragon) said to be eating a man. Well it is difficult to come to conclusion regarding the real meaning of the logo but it is famously said that the symbol comes from one of the famous families of Milan, The Visconti Family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said that during one of the crusades, Ottone Visconti fought against a noble Saracen knight. After defeating him, as the tradition went, he took the emblem of the Knight and carried it as a badge on his shoulders. That emblem had human coming out of a snake signifying &#39;<em>new and purified man</em>&#39; which basically symbolized REBIRTH. Although this is one of the many theories attributed to the logo, it is nevertheless highly interesting and urges one to dig more into the history of it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Porsche</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/porsche-logo.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>One logo that has many interesting elements is that of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche\">Porsche</a>. The coat of arms &ndash; the horse &ndash; the mention of Stuttgart &ndash; the different colored strips &ndash; all have a different story behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\">It is said that, &quot;<em>At the initiating of the 1950s, famous Professor Ferdinand Porsche, son Ferry and the trusted circle decided about developing a manufacturer&#39;s emblem that they wanted both to devote to their city Stuttgart and to possess a dynamic, powerful identity</em>&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emblem has been inspired from the great history of W&uuml;rttemberg-Baden. The coat of arms symbolizes great strength and the prancing stallion is a constant reminder that the native Stuttgart brand was created in a horse farm in 960. The entire logo is in the shape of a crest which can be attributed to the age old traditions of W&uuml;rttemberg-Baden.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Since we have always believed the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a> have a universe of their own and the first men of this universe, the founders of these lovely super cars were an institution in themselves. They have had the most humble beginnings and raised an empire out of dust. Here we bring you the First Men of all notable Luxury car brands and a sneak peek to their past.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Enzo Ferrari</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Enzo Ferrari\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Enzo-Ferrari.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The founder of the Italian motor brand, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a>! He is famously known for being a superb motor racing driver and an immaculate entrepreneur. But before becoming THE ENZO FERRARI, he worked at the Costruzioni Meccaniche National factory, scrapping trucks into small cars. How inspiring is that!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Walter Percy Chrysler</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Walter-Percy-Chrysler\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Walter-Percy-Chrysler.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The founder of the <a href=\"https://www.chrysler.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler Corporation</a>, W.P. Chrysler, worked as a machinist in a series of railroad shops throughout the Midwest. Before Chrysler Corporation was born, he worked at various railroads as a roundhouse mechanic throughout the west. Well to be the best, there surely goes more hard work than what the others see.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lionel Martin</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lionel Martin\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Lionel-Martin.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Lionel Martin ran a small shop in London&#39;s Kensington district but then later he decided to self-assemble cars, which then led to the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.astonmartin.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Aston Martin</a>. For ages, Aston Martin has constantly risen to become more than just a luxury car brand. Its identity has been equated with James Bond for it being the ultimate Bond mobile. To rise the empire to such levels, Mr. Martin humble beginnings tell us a lot about success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Walter Owen Bentley</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Walter Owen Bentley\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Walter-Owen-Bentley.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first man for <a href=\"https://www.bentleymotors.com/en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bentley</a> and its spectacular legacy was a genius in himself. He was an English engineer who designed engines for cars and aircrafts. He was famously known as W.O. without any mention of his surname &#39;Bentley&#39;. He with his brother and Clive Gallop, after war, developed the 3-litre engine that ran for the first time in the streets of London in 1920.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ferruccio Lamborghini</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ferruccio Lamborghini\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Ferruccio-Lamborghini.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferruccio Elio Arturo Lamborghini, The founder of Lamborghini brand, was born to grape farmers but his mechanical inclination and know-how led him to the tractor business in 1948. As the tale (more like a folk lore) goes, Ferruccio owned a Ferrari that he once took for servicing however he was insulted and called a truck driver. Ferruccio, obviously furious, went back and asked one of his mechanics to fix the engine. The mechanic who specialized in trucks used their same skills for a car like Ferrari, which led to the foundation of the famous <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">LAMBORGHINI</a>. The percentage of truth in this tale could probably never be known but one thing which is certain is that Mr. Lamborghini&#39;s mechanical abilities and hard work are to be thanked for the amazing creation of Lamborghini cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Henry Royce</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Henry Royce\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Henry-Royce.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sir Frederick Henry Royce founded the <a href=\"https://www.rolls-royce.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rolls Royce Company</a> along with his partner Charles Rolls. He started with an apprenticeship in the Great Northern Railways with a little financial assistance of his aunt. But soon he faces a financial crunch and was forced to leave the apprenticeship and work on streets and theatre lights. But surely it was his vision and his consistent zeal to achieve much higher than what we had in hand which helped him to turn the luck around and rest, they say, is history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>These men or so we call First Men inspire us immensely to try and achieve what we dream for. From the circumstances they rose and built such humongous empires is really appreciable and commendable. </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Every <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lexus\">Lexus car</a> will come with a new promise to blow your mind with improved features and high-end technology. So, this is the list of the models and what expectations you could set with your next Lexus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus ES</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"lexus-ES-car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus-ES.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.lexus.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>First entry in this article is <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/ES\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lexus ES</a>, which is one of the most distinguished and luxurious models. The ES design looks quite confident; credit goes to the subtle yet significant face-lift the company gives to this model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>It now has a larger and bolder space; the look is more &#39;predator-like&#39; rather than being a docile posh car, interior has a lavish feel in new color combos and finishes and the headlamps and fog lamps are made up of an astonishing combination of glass and metal. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The safety feature package has become more advanced. The new ES comes with adaptive cruise, hi-tech lane-departure warning, pedestrian detection, and last but not least <em><strong>forward-collision alert</strong></em> within a reasonable sub-$650 option price.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus GS F</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lexus GS F\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus-GS-F.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://wall.alphacoders.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>They say in <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/GSF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lexus GS F</a>, &quot;F&quot; stands for &#39;Finesse and Fun&#39; and we say &#39;Bang on&#39;. Though people say that perfection doesn&#39;t need any improvement, however, we still believe that &#39;change is life&#39; and everything seems to be perfect until we find a competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>So, to keep its game &#39;up and running&#39;, Lexus GS has eventually pressed &quot;F5&quot; button. Hi-tech infotainment system, cutting-edge safety features, modernized bumpers and a reworked interior, GS F is all set to make its mark this year. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is sporty, edgy and every man&#39;s dream car, which now has turbocharged engine to roar and to rule more. GS F&#39;s upgraded engine, power and ultra-performance have put Lexus on equal footing with European competitors like <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a>. It has maintained an interesting balance of a luxury cruiser and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sports car</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus IS</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"lexus-IS\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus-IS.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.lexus.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sad news is IS250 is being scrapped; good news is Lexus is replacing it with two new models, i.e. a turbocharged four-cylinder <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/IS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">IS 200t</a> and all-wheel-drive IS 300 carrying 3.5ltrs V6 engine (IS300 is an affordable version).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These newborn babies are precise along with well-tuned steering that promises high performance and confidence to the drivers in all the terrains and situations. Lexus lovers definitely have something to look forward and could expect to own powerful sporty models to take on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus LX</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"lexus-LX\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus-LX.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.lexus.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/LX\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> royal Lexus LX</a> has already undergone massive two updates since 2007 (2007 being its design overhaul), 2016 will bring its third revamped version of LX. We definitely expect and hope that this redesign brings out the best of technological enhancements, plush interiors and unmatched styling in order to keep up with today&#39;s competitive auto industry market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>However, on safety front, Lexus has come up with the Pre-Collision System (PCS) to detect pedestrian along with lane departure warning system and most interestingly &#39;radar cruise control&#39; that notifies the driver of forthcoming collision and takes independent braking action in emergency. With such advanced technologies, Lexus definitely made us curious enough to see LX going face-off with its big rivals like <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/q7\">Audi Q7</a> and Cadillac Escalade. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus RC</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"lexus-RC\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus-RC.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.lexus-int.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>On this one Lexus hasn&#39;t done too much of talking in the media however, this car shows a lot potential to its drivers. From a plain surface to the rough ones, <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/RC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lexus RC</a> is capable of doing almost everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>It does consistently perform well but won&#39;t promise to excel and this one deficient might not get its many lovers. Lexus has made sure to redesign while keeping better fuel economy in mind.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus RX</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"lexus-RX\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lexus-RX.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.lexus.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Last entry in this article is Lexus&#39;s most important model RX; in other words RX is &#39;THE&#39; showstopper of the complete Lexus fleet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, customers will see <a href=\"https://www.lexus.com/models/RX\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the &#39;all new&#39; RX</a> with bold styling and monstrous look. The new fourth-generation RX epitomizes the most drastic departure from Lexus&#39; traditionally demure, old school styling in the company&#39;s SUV history. It&#39;s more aggressive and vocal in appearance and that&#39;s the real punch we all were waiting to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em>The 2-inch longer wheelbase provides more stretch-out room in the second row, 3.3-liter V-6 pumps out 30-HP more (making it approximately 300-HP), and 8-speed transmission promises a flying experience on the road. Comparing the new RX with its predecessors, this one is more fun and has got all the impressive features to make it one of your &#39;<strong>GO-TO</strong>&#39; cars.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

There are many cars that ride well and puts a grin on your face every time you floor the throttle. But when you want all these and much more from a single car, the choices are very limited &ndash; and among the few choices, it will be hard pressed to find a car that is more suited than the <a href=\"https://www.mini.in/mini_countryman/cooper_d/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mini Countryman</a>, the not so mini, MINI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mini\">MINI</a> that drives like any other MINI, but can seat five in comfort and carry their luggage, offer 4-wheeldrive and can take you over rough terrain without sweating a drop, or can take you to the nearest shopping mall in comfort and carry all the shopping bags without a whimper.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countryman is the first SUV from MINI and is the second most popular offering from the MINI stable. Contrary to the original Countryman, the new Countryman is a 4-wheel drive, 5 Door SUV and is developed aiming the family audience, who like to have a car that is practical as well as thrilling to drive. Don&#39;t be fooled by the looks, as under that bloated MINI looks is a very capable SUV that has better credentials than many <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">other hard core SUVs</a> can boast &ndash; MINI has won the prestigious and tough as hell DAKAR rally four times and the rally car is based on none other than the MINI Countryman.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Design-of-Mini-Countryman\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Design-of-Mini-Countryman.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Unmistakably, this is the largest MINI &ndash; MINI that has never embraced the bulk like this for before and it shows in the amount of space it owns inside the car. Even though the car is substantially larger than regular MINIs, the design remains unmistakably of MINI. The Countryman broke many moulds in design from the family Tradition, as it was the first member of the family to get four doors plus a large tailgate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The car is a foot longer, 10cm wider and 15cm taller than the regular MINI hatch. This results in the Countryman having an upright stance &ndash; a departure from the hunkered down stance of MINI hatch. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The front is dominated by the signature grill and large and intricately designed headlights &ndash; you can opt for LED headlights and fog lights, if you wish so. The bonnet, true to the MINI fashion, covers the wings and encloses the headlights. The contrasting roof and mirrors add to the oomph factor and helps the MINI to stand out from the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><strong><em>MINI offers a staggering 10 million unique combinations to <a href=\"https://ssl.mini.in/configurator/index.html?action=vco.selectConfiguration&amp;model=XD32&amp;vgCode=XD32#component_0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">customize your Countryman</a>, so that you can tailor the car just like the way you like it.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>INTERIORS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Open the door and what strikes you is the fact that the interior is 100% MINI, despite the fact that the dashboard is new and is not shared with any other models from the maker. The dominating theme is circular and the speedometer and the center console are a study in circles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>The power window switches and the speedometer are located where they should be, and all the plastics are soft at touch and of top quality. The center console is dominated by the high definition color screen and the absolutely drool worthy toggle switches, made of premium materials.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mini comes with ambient lighting and you can choose from 12 patters and wait for the staggering 255-color tones. The center display works as the entertainment hub and also displays the navigation maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Countryman comes with MINI Connected &ndash; a display that seamlessly integrates all the technology &ndash; from popular Apps to Popular hardware like GoPro and a lot more. This also powers the Journey mate, the trip planner app from MINI, which takes parameters like real time traffic, mileage, weather etc. and integrates them to the trip planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It even comes with a gas station finder, when you are low on gas and on lookout for a place to top up. It also comes equipped with a parking space finder that helps you to find parking space for your MINI. <em><strong>The entertainment junkies can opt for a high end Harman Kardon HIFI Audio System.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The space between the front seats has a rail, which can take sliding accessories that you can choose from the customization catalogue. The rear seats offer split folding and are adjustable to release more cargo space, if needed. The boot is a generous 350-liter and can extend up to 1170-liter if the rear seats are folded down. There is lot of head, shoulder and elbow room and the sliding rear seats make it comfortable for the rear passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ADVANCE FEATURES</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Advance-Features\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Advance-Features23.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.thecarconnection.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>MINI is loaded with lot of advance features like Park Distance Control, navigation with real-time update, corner brake control, Dynamic Stability Control, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em><strong>Park Distance Control</strong></em> uses ultrasonic waves to find obstacles and the distance between them and the car and pops up alerts on the screen when you get closer to the objects. The <strong><em>corner brake control</em></strong> helps improve the vehicle stability even under hard cornering and keeps your MINI stable even if you have to apply brake during taking a corner or changing lanes by optimizing the braking pressure applied on each wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The <strong>Dynamic Stability Control</strong> measures steering angle, Yaw and lateral acceleration and if detects that the car is moving away from the intended path, will apply corrective measures like applying brake pressures to individual wheels and adjusting engine torque so that the car stays on course.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAFETY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mini.in/mini_countryman/cooper_d/safety/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MINI is one of the safest cars</a> around and for the fifth year in a row, The <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)</a> has awarded the MINI Countryman the prestigious Top Safety pick award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The car has seven airbags (front, side, side-curtain and knee) and crash sensors that will unlock the car and will turn on the interior and hazard lights and will cut off the ignition if the airbags are deployed. Mini boasts of an ultra-rigid body and an extremely strong frame made from second generation multiphase steel. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MINI comes with Automatic Stability control + Traction that prevents the front wheel from spinning under challenging circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ENGINE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Car Engine BBT\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Engine23.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em>Internationally, the Countryman comes with a 1.6-liter petrol engine (normally aspirated in Countryman and Countryman Cooper and with forced induction on <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mini/cooper\">Cooper</a> S and JCW) and the power varies from 97bhp to 215bhp in JCW AVATAR, which enables the MINI to do a 0-60mph under 6.9 seconds. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Countryman D comes with a 1.6-liter that churns out 112bhp and 270Nm of power and torque, which takes the car to a maximum 186Km/h of top speed. The car is mated with an automatic tranny and comes with performance suspension and all-wheel drive to make sure that you can take your Countryman anywhere, regardless of the terrain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>The MINI Countryman starts from 3,65,0000 INR and is available at a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">dealer near you</a> in the metros. </strong></em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

There is something which the cars made in Italy do incredibly well &ndash; tug the heartstrings and understand the drivers like no one else can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, it is no mean task to be counted as one of the top supercars designed in Italy, with not two but four doors. It is not a feat which can be claimed by many &ndash; unless the car in question is the <a href=\"https://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/quattroporte/quattroporte-330.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Maserati Quattroporte</a> &ndash; a perfect study in combining form and function to charisma and passion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Maserati Quattroporte (translatable literally into Maserati Four Door, but name the mundane in Italian and it sounds exotic and desirable, we know) is at attestation to the fact that Italians can make anything look incredibly beautiful and functional at same time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This almost a limo Maserati is draped in graceful lines and is cleverly designed to hide its bulk &ndash; so much so that, unless you are really viewing it side on, the car don&#39;t looks its size. The hunkered down stance, the imposing oval grill with the pride of place Maserati Trident emblem and the signature air vents &ndash; all these gives the car a unique stance that announces your arrival.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing that will strike you when viewed head on is the traditional oval shaped wide Maserati grill with the Trident logo and the long and sleek bonnet. The design is dominated by powerful lines and graceful ripples that envelope a muscular and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">sporty sedan</a>, which if full of refinement and class &ndash; a design draped in traditional Maserati garb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The uniquely shaped headlights adorn either sides of the wide grill and give the front an aggressive stance. The wraparound headlights merge seamlessly into the side of the car, which is characterized by the signature porthole like air vents that are beautiful and functional. The front gets rather large air intakes and LED daylight running lights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The side silhouette is accented by the strong character line that starts from side and follows to the flanks and then to a characteristic rear end. The rear is dominated by wraparound LED tail lights and twin oval shaped, steel exhaust pipes and the thick chrome central trim that joins the tail lights that sustains the sporty character of the design.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are few unique detailing touches that make the car stand out &ndash; the triangular C pillar wears the iconic <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/maserati\">Maserati</a> &#39;Seattle&#39; logo like all the previous generation of Quattroporte. There is an integrated rear spoiler that adds to the silhouette and keeps the car steady at high speeds by generating required downforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spokes on the standard 19-inch alloy wheels resemble the prongs of the Maserati Trident &ndash; a detail which will be appreciated by many. The body lines and the silhouette of the Quattroporte resemble a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/coupe\">coupe</a> than a sedan &ndash; a noticeable achievement of the design team, which masks the length and makes the car looks more graceful and sporty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>INTERIOR</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Maserati Quattroporte INTERIOR\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Interior23.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.thecarconnection.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Step inside and the first thing you will notice is the abundance of top quality materials &ndash; finest quality leather and natural wood, hand crafted to perfection. The layout is traditional Maserati, interwoven with modern creature comforts. The interior is designed to resemble a lounge and the emphasis in equal parts is on the craftsmanship and quality. The cabin is not busy and the layout is more elegant in nature than being a <em>tour-de-force</em> in latest technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dashboard is divided into three different levels, but at the center, there is a huge high definition touchscreen display measuring 8.4-inch, featuring the navigation and other controls. The dashboard, the center tunnels and doors have acres of open-pore wood with fine vein patterns and knots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>You can pick and choose the wood, leather and aluminum trims from a wide array of choices so that the interior is tailored to your taste.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multi-function steering wheel is wrapped in fine leather and hosts the controls for voice, multimedia, cruise, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seats are wide and deep, and come wrapped in finest leather, hand stitched to perfection. The front seats offer a wide array of adjustments &ndash; height, lumbar, back, depth and angle. These are complemented by adjustable pedals so finding the right driving position is just a button touch away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SOUND</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Maserati is renowned for its engine sound track, and the Quattroporte comes with an equally incredible sound system for in-cabin entertainment also. The discerning connoisseur in you can choose the Quattroporte to be tailored with either a Bowers &amp; Wilkins premium sound system or a Harman Kardon premium sound system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The B&amp;W system offers concert hall level acoustics and comes with 15 high quality speakers and a 16-channel 1,280 watt amplifier. The <a href=\"https://www.harmankardon.com/content?ContentID=automotive\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Harman Kardon system</a> uses cutting edge digital sound processing technology and comes with 10 high quality speakers and a 12 channel Class-D amplifier, which provides 360 degree of sound reproduction, irrespective of the seating position.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BESPOKE TOUCHES</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No super luxury car is complete without custom touches and the story of Quattroporte is no different. <em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">You can choose the colors and materials of the interiors and the limit of these choices is your creativity.</span></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior trims can even be in a special glossy finish carbon fiber, if you want to impart that special sporty touch to the interiors, which can be complemented with aluminum paddle shifters and control pedals done in brushed steel with rubber inserts. Those who want to be more in tune with nature can opt for the Ermenegildo Zegna packages that offer interiors done in finest Mulberry natural silk, in a choice of colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ENGINE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"3-liter bi-turbo V6 outputs a healthy power of 330BHP \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Engine224.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.thecarconnection.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em>The Quattroporte comes with the most advanced engines ever produced by Maserati. The base 3-liter bi-turbo V6 outputs a healthy power of 330BHP and is tuned to minimize the turbo lag and offer high efficacy and excellent performance.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same V6 in the Quattroporte S produces 410BHP of power while the top-of-the- line GTS has a roaring V8 measuring 3.8L, with an output of 530BHP and 524 lb-ft of torque, which can take the Quattroporte to 300km/h and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who want diesel power, the Quattroporte is available with a 3.0-liter V6 turbo diesel that churns out 275BHP and 443lb-ft of torque.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>If you ask someone to name their favorite <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sports car</a>, there will be few conflicting answers. Some will side with Ferrari while some may like Lamborghini, Maserati et al. In the same way, answers will vary for the ultimate luxury cars, where some will favor Rolls Royce, while the others will name Bentley or other premium brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, if you ever ask anyone what is the most GANGSTA looking car currently in production, you will hear the majority saying &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.chrysler.com/en/300/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler 300</a>. When first introduced to market in 2004, the 300 was the definition of muscular &ndash; slab sided, broad shouldered and to an extent ominous looking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>It won&#39;t be far-fetched to say that the car scared the living daylights out of all other sedans and was the bedrock on which Chrysler took escape during the tumultuous times and kept the cash register ringing so that the company didn&#39;t go under the weather.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the year 2016, Chrysler has gently toned down the 300 and now it looks more like the upmarket, swanky cousin of original 300 &ndash; the original square lines made way to more refined, softer looks; the high beltline is less pronounced and the cabin is more airy. But all said and done, the car still retains the charisma and is still one heck of a GANGSTA machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>THE DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>THE DESIGN The 300 is a full size <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">sedan</a> and there is no masking the fact that the car is big &ndash; on the contrary, the design makes it stand out from the other full size sedans by being big and bold and suave and charismatic, at the same time. Those highly pronounced waistline, the <em><strong>&#39;on your face&#39;</strong></em>, are now replaced by <em><strong>&#39;don&#39;t mess with me&#39;</strong></em> square lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The front grill is now 32 percent larger &ndash; the slats are replaced by mesh type grill with a floating badge, the lights are projector units with DRLs, and the rear gains new tail lamps. The front and rear fascias give the car an aggressive stance and the design is an amalgam of sculptured curves and modern design touches.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of chrome accents depending on the trim, done in bright chrome, black chrome or in platinum chrome (as in the case of 300C Platinum Edition). The external mirrors and door handles can be draped in chrome or platinum chrome, and there is a dual pane panoramic sunroof for those who love the outdoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rear of the car gets redesigned tail lights and dual exhaust tips shrouded in chrome &ndash; black or bright depending on the trim level. These trapezoidal bright tipped exhausts give the rear an aggressive stance. The car comes with 17, 18, 19 or 20-inch wheels, depending on the model and offers a variety of designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The 300 comes with bi-functional projector headlights that reduce the glare and offer better visibility and come with LED DRLs, LED tail lights and optional LED fog lamps. You can kit your 300 with HID headlights or automatic High-Beam control headlights that switch automatically from high to lo when light from oncoming traffic is detected. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>INTERIOR</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The interior is upgraded\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/interior50.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.moibbk.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior is upgraded from the original 300 and now features premium materials. The car has ample space to cocoon four adults and all models come with leather trimmed seats with detailed stitch patterns. The front seats are power adjustable (8-way) and offer 4 way lumbar adjustments and you can opt for heated and ventilated seats with memory function, which memorizes the seat position, external power mirrors and your favorite radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>There is a 7-inch digital display nestled between the analogue gauges that is customizable (with over 7,000 customizable views) and offers a host of information to the driver. The center console is dominated by the rather large high definition color display and is used to control the cabin functions and also displays the navigation. All the dials are illuminated by a soothing blue glow that gives the cabin an airy ambiance. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multifunction steering wheel is leather wrapped and offers switches made from high quality materials. The switches click with a quality feel, and have the controls for speed, audio and voice commands, customizable driver display, etc. Depending on the trim, the steering wheel gets real wood or nappa leather and paddle shifters and, if desired, a heated steering wheel with power adjustment can be made available as an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bulky imposing gear shifter has made way to the more suave gear selector knob and controls the new ZF sourced 8-speed auto tranny.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAFETY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Chrysler has equipped 300 with a lot of passive and active safety tech &ndash; Parksense, Blind Spot monitoring, rear cross path detection, adaptive cruise control with stop, forward collision warning with active brake, lane sense including lane departure warning and lane keep assist etc. </span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Parksense detects objects in front and rear of the car while parking, and warns the driver of potential impacts. The Parkview camera comes up automatically on the center screen when the car is shifted to reverse gear and the dynamic grid lines helps you to park expertly, without hassle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During rainy days, the 300 watches out for you by engaging the rain brake assist &ndash; when you engage the windshield wiper, the brake pads are automatically kept dry by applying a bit of pressure, thus increasing the efficiency and bringing down the brake distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The adaptive cruise control automatically adjusts the speed by taking the input of traffic ahead and if needed, can bring the car to a complete stop. The front collision warning alerts the driver by way of visual prompts if a collision is detected and can apply auto brakes if the driver fails to apply the same on time. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ENGINE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The 300 comes in 2 engine options \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Engine50.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.lookautophoto.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em>The 300 comes in 2 engine options of 3.6L Pentastar V6 that delivers 292bhp and 260lb-ft torque &amp; 300bhp and 264 lb-ft torque, according to the trim, or you can have the 300 with the fabulous 5.7L V8 HEMI that churns out 363bhp and 394lb-ft torque. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the engines are mated with a ZF sourced advanced 8-speed auto tranny, coupled with a rotary gearshift knob that activates the gearshift selection electronically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 300 comes with one of the most advanced 4-wheeldrive systems in its class and gets automatically engaged at any speeds without driver input. The 4-wheeldrive system delivers infinitely variable torque split combinations, and offers an axle disconnect function and electronic stability control and real time powertrain control, that results in excellent grip, traction and control under all circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>When you feel the need to go pedal to metal, 300 comes with a sports mode that increases the accelerator pedal response, quickens the shift timings, adjusts the power steering and engages the 4-wheeldrive system all the time. </em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The first replacement is <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/model/class-GLC/model-GLC300W4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class</a> that has taken place of the old GLK-Class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>This high-end, classier and roomier version could be a great choice for a compact <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">luxury crossover SUV</a></strong>. So, if you are a Mercedes fanatic and desire to own a SUV with a sport feel then read on, because this article would definitely tempt you enough to book the new GLC today only. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What to Look for?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>GLC300 has all the qualities to go drooling over for instance; more elegant and plush interior, macho exterior design, a &#39;never-seen&#39; combination of performance and comfort, laced with hi-tech safety equipment, plenty of leg room and head space for your family and friends, more cargo space, advanced infotainment system and a powerful fuel-efficient turbocharged engine; all in a great price.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Changes that Made 2016 a Promising Year for GLC300</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"GLC300\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Exterior-of-GLC300.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.leftlanenews.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A completely redesigned and revamped GLC-Class joins the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a> lineup. In this fast-paced and always-on-the-go lifestyle, where <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">crossover SUVs</a> are outselling classy sedans, the GLC-Class stores a great future in the market. Auto Gurus have predicted it becoming the &#39;BESTSELLER&#39; in its segment really soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping hopes and expectations soaring, the 2016 GLC-Class has completely changed with better suspension and drivetrain, wider wheelbase (4.7-inches longer and 2-inches wider than its predecessor), capacious rear seat to accommodate a good number of passengers, better cargo space and last but not the least less weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em>So, there is a lot to keep wishing for its customers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Better Changes Mean Better PERFORMANCE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Competing with the brands like Kia, Ford and Chevy, GLC-Class has turbo 4 with 273lb-ft of torque along with 9-speed automatic transmission. According to the makers, GLC-Classis <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\"><em>&#39;sports car&#39;</em></a> personified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>It offers different driving modes that manifold the muscular personality of the model. Its Sport or Sport+ mode gives the car wings and it starts behaving like a true sports car, rougher and more responsive and rule like <strong>&#39;the king of the twisted roads&#39;</strong>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Powered by a 2.0-liter bi-turbo 4-cylinder engine the car pumps out a maximum power of 241 horsepower via smooth nine-speed transmission. GLC300 is a feather-like light SUV promising fast and furious drive for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>High-end Interior and Spaciousness makes a Great SUV</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"High-end Interior Mercedes-Benz GLC300 \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/INTERIOR222.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.mbusa.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>GLC300 promises a luxurious drive with a better looking dashboard; however the highlight is the Distronic Plus feature, which means your <em><strong>&#39;soon-to-be-favorite&#39;</strong></em> GLC300 can practically drive itself without you manning it. Doesn&#39;t feel enough to get tempted? Read on!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With smooth like velvet interior, GLC300 offers a classy mix of different textures and materials. Black &amp; White high-end leather, ash wood trim and magnificent looking neat accents like ambient lighting, topstitched door panel trim and so on make GLC300 a <em><strong>&#39;pure indulgence&#39;</strong></em>. Its quiet cabin provides well-balanced steering, brakes and transmission controls offering a drive to remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Mercedes-Benz has very well collaborated advanced technology along with its fleshy looks. It is decked-up with a clickable touchpad and a rotary scroll wheel to control the infotainment system. Though the complete system is not very user-friendly, it, however, surely pays full attention in keeping your trip entertained and pleasurable.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revamp of the old GLK has given a better output and that is making GLC roomier and commodious without making it heavy. This improvement has definitely given its customers a spacious SUV with more head, shoulder and legroom. You will also find more space in the backside of the car, i.e. <strong><em>CARGO</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bigText\"><em>Additionally, the foldable rear seats can be gathered up increasing more cargo space from 20.6 cubic feet to 56.5 cubic feet, which means it can swallow up more luggage for a long trip.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>New Muscular Exterior &ndash; A Rowdy Look</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Rowdy Look - Mercedes-Benz GLC300 \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/New-muscular-exterior.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.topgear.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The new GLC300 has shed away the old boxy look of the GLK. Its rounded exterior has an opulent and buoyant style, in tune with the present Mercedes lineup. Overall, we would say that this model is more handsome and well appointed in comparison to <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw/x-series\">BMW X5</a> and Audi Q5. Its muscular design has leaner look and not a bulky one, which would make this model a definite hit amongst young blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Verdict: It&#39;s a total &#39;YAY&#39;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For quite some time, almost every new product of the Mercedes-Benz is a makeover of an old model. But how does this repetitive decision, affecting the company&#39;s business, is not our concern? Well, we are just happy that this time the German maker has decided to redesign its new model, which could be the biggest moneymaking SUV for the makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we would highly recommend this massive crossover SUV to the Mercedes lovers. Its lavish interior, rowdy look and sporty attitude, everything together makes it a winning choice. The extra horsepower and torque and spaciousness make a big difference in how the SUV feels, and if you are also on the same page then GLC300 is &quot;THE SUV&quot; for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>We wish and hope that GLC, being a great crossover SUV, see higher sales and a great year just like its predecessor GLK and write its own dazzling history.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Traditionally, the GT cars are meant for touring across long distance in high speed and are designed to carry the occupants and their luggage in style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>Most GTs are either 2 seater or uses 2+2 seating layout, and are made to handle spirited driving across various terrains. So, when <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/maserati\">Maserati</a> set out to create their first GT in 2007, it was no wonder that they came up with an achingly beautiful example of how the GranTurismo cars should be.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maserati GranTurismo has evolved over the years and has always counted as one of the top GT cars in the world, rubbing shoulders with Ferrari, Bentley and the likes. Even though there are more than few <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_tourer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Tourer cars</a> are available to carve your touring spirit, when it comes to marry the practicality with occasion and grandeur, there are not many which do it as good as the Maserati.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GranTurismo is a perfect mix of elegance and class, of poised beauty and surefooted handling and unmatched performance, with a sonorous engine to boot. The ride is not overly firm (the car was not designed to run rings around a racetrack, thankfully) but offers phenomenal grip around corners so that you are never afraid to push the car, and while the car is rooted in tradition, Maserati has thankfully not shown restraint in kitting the car with modern improvements and gadgetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>The result is a fine balance of Italian flair, wrapped in a heartbeat raising silhouette, ready to make each moment an occasion &ndash; a true choice for the discerning gentleman.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DESIGN</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Design of Maserati GranTurismo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Design-Maserati-GranTurismo.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.topgear.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The GranTurismo is built of a shortened Quattroporte chassis and is a two door <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/coupe\">coupe</a>, which can seat four adults in comfort. The front is dominated by a striking traditional Maserati oval shaped grill with the Trident logo, flanked by two sculptured headlights. The car is styled by Pininfarina, and is inspired by the iconic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati_Birdcage_75th\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Maserati Birdcage 75th concept car</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The long bonnet and the radiator grill and the LED daylight running lights give the front an aggressive air, which is accented by the air intakes placed low.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design is tough and the powerlines on the hood and the character lines on the sides give the car a muscular stance. The design has a certain tightness, like a tailor made suit over a fine body. These lines give the coupe a silhouette that combines practicality and elegance like no other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewed from side, the porthole shaped signature air intakes and the discrete skirts sets the tone of the design and aids the aerodynamic characteristic of the car. The whole design is perfected in a wind tunnel to offer very low coefficient of drag and high aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The rear pillar has the handsome and traditional Maserati &#39;Saetta&#39; logo and the rear gets the futuristic LED taillights that are made of 96 individual elements. There is an integrated diffuser at the rear that gives the much needed downforce and aids the grip during spirited driving.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>INTERIOR</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Interior of Maserati GranTurismo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Interior-Maserati-GranTurismo.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://cdn.pinthiscars.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The coupe&#39;s interior is deceptively roomy &ndash; the car can seat four adults comfortably in total luxury. The inside cabin is sporty and luxurious and uses top quality materials in abundance. The design is themed on a sporty V shape, which runs across the dashboard; is airy; and sets an example of simplistic elegance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The handcrafted interiors are painstakingly detailed, and feature lot of rich refined finishing touches that adds to the ambiance. The meaty steering wheel is clad in leather and features controls for audio, telephony and multimedia. The sporty paddle shifters lined with Alcantara adds to the sporty touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The dashboard houses the 7-inch high definition Maserati Multimedia System screen and various control switchgears. The car comes with dual zone auto climate system and an optional Bose sound system to please the audio enthusiasts.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wide and sporty seats are covered by luxurious handmade Poltrona Frau Leather that takes months of hard work to produce and look better as it wears. The seats offer generous room and a host of electronic adjustments so that you can find your desired seating position without any difficulty. The seats offer easy adjustments to enable easy ingress and egress to the occupants of rear seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BESPOKE OFFERINGS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>No luxury car is complete without customization and Maserati offers a <a href=\"https://www.configurator.maserati.com/configurator/v2/?modelName=GT&amp;currentCountry=97&amp;lang=en&amp;version=87\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">customization program</a> which is one of the best in the industry. The nature of Maserati production line ensures that each and every whim and fancy of the customer is catered to, in truly Maserati fashion, with utmost care and detail.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interiors can be done up in either Poltrona Frau leather or in Alcantara, and the customer can choose from array of colors spanning <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>10 leather color choices and 14 stitch color choices</strong></span> for different surfaces. There are 9 different shades of carpets on order, which can match the interior color selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than these, the customer can choose bespoke decorative features and can choose from two different tones of chrome or four wood finishes and two varnished panels for areas such as dashboard moldings, door and rear side panels, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em><strong>There are wide arrays of electronic equipment to choose from as well &ndash; such as electro chromatic rear view mirrors, TPMS etc.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>UNDER THE HOOD</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"engine of Maserati GranTurismo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Under-the-hood-Maserati-GranTurismo.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.moibbk.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The GranTurismo is a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sports car</a> under the skin and it shows up in each and every aspect, once you go there. The car boasts a near perfect 49:51 weight distribution that aids the handling and the rigid frame, and the special layout of wishbone suspension keeps the car glued to the road all the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this car is not designed to go fast around tracks and that is a huge plus point because the suspension is forgiving and plush, not overly firm and jarring &ndash; which is something anyone will appreciate on a daily use car. The optional computer controlled skyhook suspension takes lot of parameters into account and continuously adapts the suspension to suit the driving conditions in real time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em><strong>The car is powered by 4.2 liter V8 with a peak output of 405BHP or a 4.7 liter V8 with an output of 460BHP, depending up on the trim. All the engines are mated with 6 speed state-of-the-art auto-adaptive automatic tranny, sourced from ZF and controlled by MC Auto Shift software.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Granturismo comes with 5 electronic handling modes, while the MC Stradale trim level has three different handling modes.

The things they have to endure on a daily basis are something we civilians cannot even imagine. Be it a gunfight or a car chase, all in a day&#39;s work, to ensure our safety. That is why the modern Governments are beefing up their police weapons, equipment and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">CARS</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While to some it may seem extravagant, it is also true that criminals today ride in fast and modified rides to evade capture. So it becomes the only logical solution for police forces to acquire fast cars into their fleet with super cars to put the criminals behind bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>We bring to you the Top 6 POLIC&Iacute;A supercars that will send chills down your spine to even think about driving above the speed limits.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dodge Charger Police Interceptor, USA</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Dodge Charger Police Interceptor\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Dodge-Charger-Police-Interceptor.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.ridelust.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The fastest police car in America, it has the power to outrun any car trying to speed away from it.

Among its prized speedsters is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brabus_Rocket\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes Benz Brabus Rocket CLS</a> (the modified version of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/cls\">Mercedes-Benz CLS-class</a>).

Yes, you got it right. He&#39;s Bruce Wayne by day and <em>Batman</em> by night. Over the years in comic books, TV shows and movies, Batman has been portrayed in various ways, from the Adam West era to the gritty Christian Bale trilogy and now the upcoming Ben Affleck franchise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And just as the caped superhero character has evolved over the years, so has Batman&#39;s choice of vehicle - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batmobile\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>the Batmobile</em></a>. The Batmobile is probably the best and coolest sidekick Batman&#39;s ever had. Even Robin has to agree to that. From the original Batmobile to the most recent <em>Tumbler</em> of the Dark Night films, the car has undergone massive changes to suit whatever adventure Batman is on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s Batman without his Batmobile? Pretty awesome still, but the Batmobile adds some extra badass-ness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We bring you a few of the most memorable Batmobiles over the years:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Batman: The TV Show (1966)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Batman: The TV Show (1966)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Batman-The-TV-Show.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: boldride.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This is arguably the first decent Batmobile, the 1966 version is instantly recognizable, and for many it still remains the most favorite Batman car. This was built around a rejected <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Futura\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1955 Lincoln Futura</a>. Bubble canopies, long fins, and an added afterburner &ndash; will make you think this was custom-built from the ground up, but you&#39;d be forgiven for thinking so. The atomic turbine engine (Ford V8) and its afterburner made sure that the acceleration was always a big thing, and the rear-mounted parachutes helped to do a 180-degree spin whenever a villain or a situation took an unexpected turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Batman (1989)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Batman (1989)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Batman.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: geekalerts.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This one was long and sleek and had a pair of bat-fins at the rear. A new breed of Batmobile was thus born: intimidating, powerful, and was painted black from tip to tail. This <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">supercar</a> was crammed with gadgets and weapons, all of them quite exciting and deadly &ndash; much like Batman&#39;s purists. Twin machine guns fired out of the bonnet, and also contained grenades powerful enough to blow up the Joker&#39;s Smilex factory. An array of shutters shielded the car in a cocoon of protective armor while the vigilante of Gotham was off prowling the rooftops. The car also had the capability to navigate the streets autonomously, using a hook to perform particularly tight turns.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Batman and Robin (1997)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Batman and Robin (1997)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Batman-and-Robin.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: rallyhaus.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This was very flashy, maybe a bit too flashy batmobile. The designers went kind of overboard with this one. As if they were trying too hard to make it look cool - which they did succeed in doing, but then again, it doesn&#39;t quite exactly scream Batman. A single seater this time, the car had a retro shape, taking inspiration from vintage <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">race cars</a> like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_D-Type\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jaguar D Type</a> and Delahaye 165. The gadgets loaded onto this car however, were fewer than the previous ones. The cockpit did feature a video call function and Batman could also kill the engine of Robin&#39;s motor bike with just a flick of a switch. Bummer for Robin, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dark Knight Trilogy</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Dark Knight Trilogy\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Dark-Knight-Trilogy.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">nerdapproved.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tumbler &ndash; This was Batman&#39;s ride from the fan favorite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Trilogy\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Knight trilogy</a> that starred Christian Bale. A militarized take on the Batmobile, while very different from its previous iterations, a very cool car and well suited for Bruce Wayne. Packed to the brim with weapons and surprises to take whatever enemy threatens the safety of Gotham down, the Tumbler is one of the most dangerous and memorable Batmobiles we&#39;ve seen over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Batman V/S Superman (2016)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Batman V/S Superman (2016)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Batman-VS-Superman.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: comicbookbrain.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>While we&#39;re yet to see Affleck&#39;s Batmobile in action, it&#39;s got looks only a black-obsessed vigilante could love. It can&#39;t be described as the most attractive ride Batman&#39;s ever had, but when you&#39;re going up against the Superman, it&#39;s fair to say that a car with no scratches is not a priority, RUGGEDNESS, however, is.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

It now seems like all the roads will lead to Geneva from 3rd March to 13th March 2016. The top names of the auto industry will be lining up for the Europe&#39;s auto event of the year. Bugatti, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/aston-martin\">Aston Martin</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley\">Bentley</a></strong>,<strong> <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a>,</strong> you simply name the auto brand worth any salt and you will find it there. Even the charm and envy of all the big shot car companies, Tesla Motors, too will be showcasing its motor muscle at the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"A Brief History Salon International De l'auto\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/geneva-ms-mage-2.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: reallymeansounds.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Geneva Motor Show is an annual auto event held in the city of Geneva in the Swiss Alps since the 1900&#39;s. The first show was held in the year of 1905 and since then has showcased most of the internal combustion engine ever built in the world. Being a European event, it offers the Carmakers from around the world a grander and neutral stage to showcase their mean machines at the show. It also helps that the Swiss don&#39;t have an active auto industry of their own and hence car makers from around the world treat it as an important annual event.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"A Brief History Salon International De l'auto\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/geneva-ms-mage-3.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: emercedesbenz.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us trace back the history of one of the most important and consistent motor shows of the world. The first show was held in the city of Geneva from April 29, 1905 to May 7, 1905. The main team behind the show&#39;s founding members were Paul Buchet (Michelin&#39;s general agent in Switzerland at the time), Geneva businessman Albert Vassali; and young engineer Jules M&eacute;gevet, who was both the owner of a car-accessories company and the President of the resurrected Swiss Trade Union Chamber for the Automobile Industry. The trio along with the help of many others managed to host the first show with 59 exhibitors showing their wares and with over 17,000 people visiting, assuring that it is a roaring success.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"A Brief History Salon International De l'auto\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/geneva-ms-mage-4.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: emercedesbenz.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly the third installment of the motor show in the year of 1907 was held in Zurich instead of Geneva. And unfortunately the fourth show wouldn&#39;t be held for another 15 years or so due to the difficult times back in the day. People of the world were able to experience the Geneva Motor show again only in the year of 1923. And by the mid 1930, it became a globally famous event attracting more than 200 exhibitors and rendering the &quot;Palais des Expositions&quot; small for the large amount of crowds and vehicles lining up for the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Geneva Motor Show differs from the other renowned motor shows of the world because it still continues to be held every year instead of the twice yearly events of the Tokyo, Detroit or <a href=\"https://www.iaa.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Frankfurt shows</a>. And more or less it is an international and comparatively neutral event where all the car companies of the world are vying for attention on an even ground. In short, it is every motorheads&#39; dream event, where the world&#39;s top notch the car companies are fighting with each other to grab the eyeballs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"A Brief History Salon International De l'auto\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/geneva-ms-mage-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: emercedesbenz.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The lineup is massive and the buildup is intense.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>One of the biggest perks of being the Head of a State is surely getting to choose a <em>National Car</em>. Well, apart from having a Private airplane, that is. Official state cars are one of the most visible symbols of a nation. Security being the topmost priority these cars are chosen to portray power, strength and professionalism at home and abroad. These <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a> are visible so often that they become somewhat an extension of the person sitting inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the patriotic thing to do is choose a car that is built in your own country, but sometimes that is not an option. Surely, a home-built car is good to portray what your country is capable of, but because of the high stakes involved, many leaders choose to go with a car that is dependable and completely secure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a list of 4 such official cars used by the Heads of State of some powerful nations:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1) Cadillac One (Barack Obama, USA)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Cadillac One (Barack Obama, USA)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Cadillac-One-Barack-Obama-USA.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: gqindia.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_state_car_(United_States)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Cadillac One</a> can be called the Air Force One of the roads. Nicknamed &#39;The Beast&#39; by the United States Secret Service, You might feel that the car looks like the Cadillac we have always known but it has been built more as a war vehicle, than a sedan. Used to transport the first man of the US, this Cadillac limo is powered by a diesel engine and is built on a robust truck platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The armor on the body and windows are stronger than you may think. They have the capability to stop an RPG attack on the President. The car contains a self-sufficient Mobile Communications Unit, an independent Oxygen system and enough firepower to ensure that the President can move safely away from a war zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2) Bentley State Limousine (Queen Elizabeth, UK)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bentley State Limousine (Queen Elizabeth, UK)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Bentley-State-Limousine-Queen-Elizabeth-UK.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: autoblog.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing that you will notice about this car is that you&#39;ve never seen a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley\">Bentley</a> quite like this. Yes, they&#39;re all a little gaudy, but this one takes the cake. The tall, round limousine bears aggressive looks due to the presence of bustle back trunk, round headlights, and upright grille. Unfortunately, Bentley has produced only two such pieces of marvel and both are increasing the beauty of the royals&#39; courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the hood of the Queen&#39;s Bentley Limo is a 6.75-liter V-8 engine that pumps out 400 horsepower and 616 pound-feet of torque, which this car needs all of to get its near-9,000-pound body moving. Recently, the Limo was converted to run on LPG, which reduces the emission output of this Bentley. The body panel and glass are all completely bulletproof and there is also a provision to seal the cabin airtight, to protect the queen in case of a gas attack. What else can be said about this car, other than <em><strong>&quot;IT DESERVES TO BE A QUEEN&quot;!</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3) BMW 7-series 760Li (Narendra Modi, India)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW 7-series 760Li (Narendra Modi, India)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/BMW-7-series-760Li-Narendra-Modi-India.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: blogspot.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The choice of car for the Indian PM is not done by the PM himself, but by the SPG (special protection group) that has certain prescribed safety and security standards and measures. Coming back to the car, it is a highly secured armor clad luxury mobile, which sports a V12 engine churning out 546PS of peak power and can do a 0-100kmph sprint is 6.2 sec and has a top speed of 210kmph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/general/corporate_direct_sales/security_vehicles/model_overview.html#7_series_high_security\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">high security car</a> is compliant with a VR7 grade of ballistic protection along with other parts adhering to a higher protection of VR9 grade. To protect the occupant from a sudden gas attack, the cabin of the mean machine can be transformed into a gas-safe chamber with the availability of a back-up oxygen tank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to the Cadillac One owned by Obama, the BMW high security edition owned by our PM has a fire-fighting system, thick bulletproof windows and emergency exit. Also, on top of the other safety features and equipment is the presence of the armor plates beneath, which can withstand bombs and mines. The tyres, if flat, can work for several kilometres without being changed and the advanced heat sensors help in protecting the passengers from bomb and missiles attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4) Mercedes S600 Pullman Guard (Pranab Mukherjee, India)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes S600 Pullman Guard (Pranab Mukherjee, India)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Mercedes-S600-Pullman-Guard-Pranab-Mukherjee-India.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: caricos.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian President surely loves to ride in style along with safety, of course. His Limo is completely soundproof and when we say completely we mean like COMPLETELY. There is absolutely no space for any sound to creep in, be it from the outside or the engine&#39;s. All this is ensured by the soundproof glass that separates President&#39;s cabin from the rest of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exteriors are definitely exceptionally beautiful but the charm is the security feature which makes it <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.com.hk/content/hongkong/mpc/mpc_hongkong_website/enng/home_mpc/passengercars/home/new_cars/mb_guard.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">THE President&#39;s car</a>. Be it arms fire or grenade explosion this vehicle can readily withstand everything. All the glass, be it windows or windshield, are as tough as it can get due to the 60mm polycarbonate coating. A self sealing 90-litre fuel tank, a fire extinguisher an emergency air supply system, a Surveillance camera for the driver who gets an alert in case of emergency and not to forget the Bullet proof tires, and many more features are the garland of this beauty.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Fast and the Furious! Doesn&#39;t matter if you hate it or love it, you just cannot miss it. Almost every one of us has heard of this movie franchise, which now is set to release its 8th installment in 2017, starring Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham. Fast and the Furious is famous for three things - Vin Diesel, the late Paul Walker and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">FAST CARS</a>. Each one of the seven films so far has been packed with action, fast car chases and unbelievable stunts. With over a hundred cars being featured over the years, it is a very difficult task to choose ones amongst them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We bring you a few cars that caught our eyes in the Fast and Furious movie series.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>70 Dodge Charger</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"70 Dodge Charger\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/70-Dodge-Charger.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: deviantart.net</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Charger_(B-body)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dodge Charger</a> was the only thing Dominic Toretto&#39;s father left him. He pulled it out of the garage in the first film to race Brian. The Charger&#39;s engine gives it a punch of 900hp and makes it a hot favorite American muscle car. And it&#39;s not just that, this car makes a comeback in two films (F&amp;F 4 and 5), to help Dominic break out of a prison bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mitsubishi Eclipse</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mitsubishi Eclipse\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Mitsubishi-Eclipse.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: pagenstecher.de</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of us might remember the <a href=\"https://fastandfurious.wikia.com/wiki/Mitsubishi_Eclipse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">neon green Mitsubishi</a> from the first Fast and Furious film. The car was molded with extreme body kits and had an underground neon lighting. The graphics on the body, however, was a tad too tacky for the eyes. That being said, it featured a 210hp, turbocharged engine. An all-wheel ride, sure to reach race first past the finish line!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>67 Ford Mustang</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"67 Ford Mustang\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/67-Ford-Mustang.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: nydailynews.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This muscle car was featured in the &#39;Tokyo Drift&#39; installment of the franchise. The only problem with the car - it needed a new engine. Being set in Japan, the only logical choice to go for was the Nissan Skyline&#39;s twin-turbo RB26. Let us not get caught up on the mechanical marvel that would include, undertaking such a swap, but it was sure a pleasure to watch the beauty, driven by Sean in the movie. If this does not qualify as Car Porn, we don&#39;t know what does.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>72 Gran Torino Sport</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"72 Gran Torino Sport\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/72-Gran-Torino-Sport.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: deviantart.net</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This beast of a car packs more muscle than any other <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/chrysler\">American cars</a> around. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Torino\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gran Torino</a> was used by Fenix to transport heroin between Mexico and the US. With a 429 V8 Cobra Jet engine, under the hood, this is without much surprise the choice of lead car for a drug unit, trying to speed past (more like underneath and through) the border, without police detection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>69 Dodge Charger Daytona</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"69 Dodge Charger Daytona\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/69-Dodge-Charger-Daytona.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: ytimg.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>For all those familiar with <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/en_us/sprint-cup-series.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">NASCAR</a>, the Daytona used to be a hot favorite. The original Dodge Charger was modified to fix the aerodynamics, so the car could fare better at super speed NASCAR circuits like Talladega and Daytona. The Daytona was supercool before it even featured in F&amp;F. When you&#39;re behind the wheel and you start up the electronics and ignition, it feels like you&#39;re sitting inside a humongous sounding drum. But there&#39;s a downside, which is the insides of the car start to feel like a furnace when its exhaust system starts heating up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2012 Lucra LC470</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"2012 Lucra LC470\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/2012-Lucra-LC470.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: gearheads.net</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Vin Diesel, alongside his cast of actors, isn&#39;t the only star that features in the films. <a href=\"https://www.lucra.cars/#!lucralc470/cihc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Lucra LC470</a> deserves to be given a casting credit of its own. With looks that give it a Jaguar&#39;ish feel, this car is fitted with a 7.0-liter V8 engine that comes to life with a thunder, roaring like a wildling. The car looks small and is very light too, but comes with massive tyres that help in maneuvering the car during fast driving and stunt scenes.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>When presented before the world in 1995, the <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in/models/tt/tt_coupe/design/exterior.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TT design</a> study shook the foundations of the modern sports car design believes. The car stayed true to the concept and took the world by storm when it was <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/audi-tt-the-head-turner\">launched</a> and appealed to the people who liked aesthetic design and liked their cars to look futuristic. Designed based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">&#39;Bauhaus&#39; school of design concepts</a>, by a very talented team of people who had an incredible background, the car was a much needed fresh air in the landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\">Audi </a></strong>TT was praised by many for the design language and the seamless use of aluminum, stainless steel and leather. From inception, aluminum has played a big role on all TTs - the side frames, upper body structure, side frames, doors, hood, hatch, roof &ndash; all these and more parts are made of aluminum.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third generation Audi TT is more of an evolution of the original design, and keeps the same unmistakable silhouette, which is a signature Audi TT. The mean machine is available in two forms &ndash; the TT and TTS &ndash; while TT has both coupe and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\">convertible</a> options; the TTS is available only as a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/coupe\">coupe</a>. In India, we get only the TT coupe, which has 2+2 seating arrangement and combines the style and practicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Design</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The design of TT is unmistakable and is often hailed as timeless and modern classic. The original TT, if launched today, will not look out of place and the third generation of the TT continues the tradition &ndash; the design is eye catching and heartbeat raising today and will remain relevant even years down the lane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>The design employs taut lines to create a design that is powerful and muscular and is vibrant and agile. The car has strong family resemblance and from some angles, looks like a baby <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/r8\">Audi&nbsp;R8</a>. The rear is horizontally designed and the headlights and tail lights are angular in nature. The headlights gets the stunning daytime running lights &ndash; one of the best implementation in industry, and a large Audi signature grill with a large Audi logo.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interiors</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Audi TT Interiors\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Audi-TT-interiors.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.carspopular.club</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The angular theme is carried inside and the interior looks cozy and oozes sportiness. The design breaks away from the traditional ones where there is a large display sitting on the middle of the dashboard. The dashboard contains a large 12.8-inch high-definition configurable display (virtual cockpit in Audi speak) and three large air vents in the middle and one for the passenger. There is no mechanical gauge anywhere - everything is completely digitalized and is configurable by the driver so that he can decide how and what information is displayed - via the classic round dial type display or ultramodern full screen views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display can be switched quickly via the multifunction steering wheel so the driver can switch from one mode to other on the fly, when needed. The screen can be configured to display media, navigation, radio, telephone and vehicle settings and the speedometer and tachometer dials can be shrunk when necessary to make space for other displays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bigText\"><strong><em>While all the controls are perfectly driver oriented (there will not be much of a case for the passenger to control a display he can&#39;t see, anyway) there is a volume knob which is placed near the passenger seat so that he/she can control the volume easily.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to know how technically complex is the <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in/models/tt/tt_coupe.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Audi TT</a>, do take a look at the air conditioners. There are three air cons in the center &ndash; and all the HVAC controls are done via the vents. The temperature can be adjusted by rotating the knob provided at the middle of the center air vent and to get the automatic mode, you need to push the knob. The fan speed is controlled by the knob on the leftmost vent, while air distribution is controlled by the right side&#39;s knob. The knobs on the vents at the extreme ends of the dashboard control the seat heater. This is an incredibly simple way to tidy the whole HAVC controls, but under the skin, it is extremely complex and has more than 20 individual parts on each air vents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The TT comes with optional S sport seats and the rest of the <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in/models/tt/tt_coupe/design/interior.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interior</a> is finished using high quality materials and the workmanship is impeccable. The steering wheel is flat bottomed and controls a plethora of information, the gear lever is sporty and is a pleasure to hold and the MMI knob is placed behind the gear lever.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multimedia jobs are taken care by the excellent <a href=\"https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/car-audio/car-models/audi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system</a> with 12 high performance speakers and a 14 channel amplifier. You can opt for the connectivity package that has Audi Bluetooth interface and seatbelt mounted MMI touch microphones for excellent voice quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Under the skin</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"he TT is powered by 2.0-liter TFSI engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Audi-TT-engine.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://flipboard.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em><strong>The third generation TT uses steel for the floor pan, engine cradle and firewall and this helps the TT to shave off some weight. In whole, the car is about 45kgs lighter than the previous model. The TT is powered by 2.0-liter <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in/models/tt/tt_coupe/technical_data/engines-and-transmission/engines/tfsi_.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TFSI engine</a> that delivers more power while giving better mileage. The engine develops 227BHP and 370Nm torque, and is mated to a 6-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox, dubbed S-Tronic.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TT comes with the Quattro all-wheel drive system and the short wheelbase (TT has the shortest wheelbase of any car built till now on <a href=\"https://www.volkswagen.co.in/en/innovation/mqb.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">VW MQB platform</a>) helps the car to achieve fast direction changes while keeping excellent grip on road.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>For car enthusiasts everything about a car is as important as the first thing. From engine to upholstery, every single minute to major detail holds extreme importance to them. Such enthusiasts have successfully created a new genre of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) for car details. A typical car enthusiast or in a more realistic term a car fanatic can be recognized by few very common features such as monthly issues of car mags, following all official <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">luxury car</a> profiles on social media, stopping in the middle of the road to click the photograph of a luxury car spotted and of course their obsession with SPEED.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such car enthusiasts or fanatics as earlier established have been basically the reason for the birth of the age old famous motor races of the world and Schumachers of the era. Hence we bring you the list of best motor races around the world:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Monaco Grand Prix</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Monaco Grand Prix\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Monaco-Grand-Prix.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: biser3a.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>First race held in 1929, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">the Monaco Grand Prix</a> is one of the first Formula 1 circuits in the world. In 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix was, in itself, an event started couple of decades before the Formula 1 even came into existence. This circuit puts the cars and their drives through a series of tests and challenges and is undoubtedly one of the most difficult circuits to race in. A very twisting circuit and also narrow, keeps drivers on their toes the whole time. Chances were if the Monaco Grand Prix was not already on the Formula 1 roster, it would have been dropped, because of the safety concerns. Be that as it may, for drivers, winning a Monaco GP is a huge thing, even if they never won a World Championship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Indianapolis 500</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Indianapolis 500\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Indianapolis-500.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: wordpress.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This track is the holy grail of all racing tracks. Popular for its open wheel races, this American circuit has a special place in the heart of automobile racing. Although, this kind of racing has been witnessing a popularity decline in America, the honor and prestige remains intact. <a href=\"https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Indianapolis 500&#39;s</a> track is filled to the brim with inspiring history and the races here are always exhilarating. Drivers across the globe, come together to race for the trophy at the Indy. The circuit, 2.5 miles in length and top speeds reaching 230mph, takes nerves and passion (a lot of it) to compete in. Some drivers have even declined to race on this circuit, because a crash on this circuit is almost never a small affair. But all risks put aside, this is one of the oldest circuits around, since the 1911 and every driver wants to bag a trophy here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Daytona 500</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Daytona 500\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Daytona-500.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: wtop.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who is even the least interested in motorsport racing has surely heard of <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/en_us/sprint-cup-series.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">NASCAR racing</a>. It is a stock car race and the <a href=\"https://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/Events/2016/DAYTONA-500/DAYTONA-500.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Daytona</a> is considered to be its most popular circuit. If any track comes close to the popularity of this circuit, it is the Indianapolis 500. The NASCAR Super Bowl was the first race to ever be broadcasted live on Television in 1979, right from the start to the finish. And what a finish it was! It can safely be said that it was because of this 1979 race at Daytona, NASCAR racing is a multi-million dollar race today. This track has witnessed some racing moments in its 65 years history and of course some tragic ones too. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Earnhardt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Dale Earnhardt</a>, considered to be one of the best NASCAR drivers, crashed his car in this circuit and did not survive the crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bathurst 1000</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bathurst 1000\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Bathurst-1000.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: thesmokingtire.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_1000\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bathurst 1000</a> is home to one of the most prestigious top 3 racing circuits in the world. 3.8 miles in length and built on a mountain, Mount Panorama, this Australian circuit is 874 metres above the sea level. This circuit hosts the wild and crazy V8 <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">Supercar</a> racing every year. It can right away be understood how wild this circuit is, if one of the first turns is known as &#39;Hell Corner&#39;. This is a circuit every Australian racecar driver dreams of winning sometime in his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>24 Hours of Nurburgring</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"24 Hours of Nurburgring\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/24-Hours-of-Nurburgring.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: lemans.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_N%C3%BCrburgring\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nurburgring</a> is unarguably one of the most dangerous racing circuits out there. Lethal, even! The extensive 15.5 mile circuit is built in the German hills. Because of the greenery all around and the deadly nature of this track that has claimed several lives; the track has been nicknamed &#39;Green Hell&#39;. No driver, unless absolutely crazy or a daredevil, takes part in this grueling race, with almost about 200 cars in an event of 24 hours. But nonetheless, this track delivers a race of races, where both Man and his Machine undergo a challenging test.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

We have always had an age old fascination with vintage things, be it wine, jewellery or cars. Nowadays, we are all about <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">Supercars</a> with super look and super fast speed and then there are also Hypercars. But Vintage is like a fruit that remains sweet all season &ndash; rain or shine. Over the years with the advancement of technology we have seen a considerable growth in the creativity, luxury and the excitement quota but the charm of the vintage cars never ceases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ford Model T (1908)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ford Model T (1908)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Ford-Model-T.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://bestcarmag.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The iconic beauty with even more iconic history. A revolution in the automobile history, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ford Model T</a> was the first car to be produced in, and not just any but a moving assembly line. The famous black Model T is still remembered in Henry Ford&#39;s quote saying that he will paint the customer&#39;s car in any color he wants till the time it&#39;s black! Although through a series of innovations the world has moved far ahead from cars like Model T but the enthusiasts still hold it very dear to their hearts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rolls Royce Phantom I (1925)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Rolls Royce Phantom I (1925)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/blog-rolls-royce-phantom-3.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://en.wheelsage.org</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in 1925 that the long legacy of one of the top luxury car brands started with the launch of its first car, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Phantom_I\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Phantom I</a>. The class, the best craftsmanship and the exceptional drivers experience are the core elements of the Phantom legacy that has been maintained even till date. The current valuation of this beauty is approximately $1.2 million that makes us believe that even a vintage car is loved and adored by many.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bugatti Type 41- Royale</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bugatti Type 41- Royale\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/bugatti-.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.fotos.org</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>1931 was the year! Yes, you heard it right. Tracing back history of the brand which gave us the best Hypercar of the world; <a href=\"https://www.bugatti.com/veyron/veyron-164/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Veyron</a>, it takes us to 1931 at the launch of the Royale or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Royale\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Bugatti type 41</a>. Originally built with the intention to be the Royal&#39;s car, hence the name, the Royale was, back then, the most luxurious cars and infact can still be given the tag. Bugatti somehow has always maintained limited production agenda. So is with Veyron and so was with Type 41 as only 6 units in total were manufactured out of which none ended up in the royalty&#39;s backyard, but of course. Given its luxury, its rich history and the fact that there are only 6 in the entire world, no wonder the car costs somewhere around $20 million and many bid with their hopes and dreams to own the &quot;Royalty&quot; itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jaguar E-Type (1961)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jaguar E-Type (1961)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Jaguar-E-Type.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://alfa-img.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If ever human race has witnessed the arrival of something so beautiful to take your breath away, it has been the launch of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_E-Type\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jaguar E type</a> in 1961. Keeping in mind the England countryside and the rough roads, it seems that this Jaguar was customized to suit the same avoiding any point of inconvenience and superior driving experience even in that era. Well speed no doubt has been the main agenda while building any supercar. The veterans had and still keep the &#39;racing&#39; aspect in mind while developing any car but E-Type broke the barriers by keeping an all round driving experience in mind. FYI, Elon Musk other than all his Tesla&#39;s still drives his 61 Jaguar E Type.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ferrari 250 TR (1958)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ferrari 250 TR (1958)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Ferrari-250-TR.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://bestcarmag.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as the logo depicts a prancing Horse, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> has always believed that every car should shout the same message and the one that holds the flag high up in the sky is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_TR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">250 Testa Rossa</a>. Testa Rossa is an institution in itself for not only other car makers but its own brand takes immense inspiration. Bagging the 24 hour Le Mans, Testa Rossa proved it was far more than just a sexy suave and classy car. And it wasn&#39;t the only badge on its coat, as the car also broke the world record by being sold at the highest auction price of $16.4 million.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Of all the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">luxury sedans</a> that have come out of America, the Chrysler 300 needs a special mention. The 300 is Chrysler&#39;s full-size top-of-the-line luxobarge that debuted at the 2003 <a href=\"https://www.autoshowny.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">New York Auto Show</a>, following which it was put on sale in 2004. For Chrysler, the 300 was an important car back then as the company hadn&#39;t produce a rear-wheel drive full-size luxury sedan since 1981. As a consequence, Chrysler&#39;s reputation was at stake and a lot of it was riding on 300&#39;s shoulder. Suffice to say, the Chrysler 300 met all the expectations, and then some&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some Excerpts from a Rival</h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>Based on Chrysler&#39;s rear-wheel drive LX platform, the 300 shared a number of components and features with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_E-Class_(W211)\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">W211 Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a>. To name a few, the rear suspension design, steering setup, electrical, automatic gearbox, all-wheel drivetrain, etc., are some of the components that are shared with the Mercedes E-Class sedan. The Chrysler 300 also features a double wishbone front suspension that is derived from the W220 Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Variants</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Chrysler 300\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/chrysler-300C-image-2.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.chrysler.com.au</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chrysler.com/en/300/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Chrysler 300</a> was offered in a number of variants upon its launch. That said, even the lower end variants of the car came decently equipped with features, meaning whichever trim you&#39;d go for, there&#39;s always that sense of luxury in the car. For instance, the base 300 featured a 2.7-litre EER V6 petrol engine developing 190PS. Power was sent to the rear wheels via a 4-speed automatic gearbox while an all-wheel drive version was optional. The Canadian-spec version of the car came standard with a bigger 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine. In 2008, Chrysler renamed the 300 as LX (the platform it&#39;s based on).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Features</h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>Feature wise, the car came equipped with standard 17-inch wheels, classy wheel covers, disc brakes on all four wheels, single-disc stereo with MP3 player, AUX connectivity, electrically-adjustable driver seat and a four-speed automatic transmission.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Engine</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"a 3.5 litre V6 petrol engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/chrysler-300C-image-3-Engine.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"redText\"><em><strong>The Chrysler 300 Touring (sedan) model also used a 3.5 litre V6 petrol engine producing a peak horsepower of 250PS and 340Nm of torque. Power transmission duties are carried out by either a 4 or 5-speed automatic transmission depending on the model year and drivetrain.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of features and equipment, the Touring models came fitted with 17-inch aluminium wheels, AM/FM radio with CD player and AUX input, traction control or Electronic Stability Program (ESP), remote keyless entry, leather seats, and SIRIUS satellite radio. There was also a Limited model that was offered the same year featuring the same V6 engine as on the Touring model. The Limited model, however, came shod with 18-inch chrome clad aluminium wheels and anti-roll bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now coming to the most popular iteration of the car &ndash; the top-of-the-range 300C. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/chrysler/300c\">The 300C</a> is perhaps the most revered and successful variant of the Chrysler 300. In many ways, it is a combination of Germany&#39;s idea of a luxury vehicle (which means meeting the top standards in car making) and American muscle (V8 motor and sheer brute force).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"dimText\"><em>For starters, the 300C featured a 5.7-litre HEMI V8 petrol engine under the bonnet. Unlike other gas-guzzling V8s though, this motor incorporates MDS (multi-displacement system), meaning the engine can automatically shut 4 cylinders of 8 when it detects less power is needed. Like, when the car is cruising down the motorway at a constant speed or while ambling around in town, the engine will save fuel using the MDS.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Performance</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"muscle car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/chrysler-300C-image-4-Test-Drive.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://media.caranddriver.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, once you mash the throttle to the floor, it will be a different story altogether; all the eight-cylinders will work in full force developing 340PS of maximum power and 530Nm of torque. Sending the power reserves from the engine to the rear wheels is a 5-speed automatic gearbox. This would turn the 300C into a typical muscle car, albeit all the occupants and passengers will be cocooned in the luxury environs of the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other advantages of using a HEMI engine was that it included a pushrod induction tube, making the 300C more fuel efficient and quicker since it pulls and pushes the air into the engine&#39;s induction system. In addition, each cylinder came fitted with two-spark plugs so as to promote efficient fuel/air mixture burn, which in turn, reduced emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Add-Ons</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the car&#39;s highlights in terms of features, the 300C came fitted as standard with 18-inch chrome-clad alloy wheels, MyGIG Infotainment system and SIRIUS Satellite Radio and backseat entertainment TV screens. In 2009, Chrysler revamped the car with a few updates, major among which was the 20PS increase in the power output of the new model, taking the horsepower count to 360PS! If that does not float your boat, then there was an even more powerful version of the car, called the 300C SRT-8. SRT is the performance arm of Chrysler, which stands for Street Racing Technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>Simply put, what they do is transform normal Chrysler and Dodge cars into borderline monsters. The 300C SRT-8 was no exception- it&#39;s fitted with a 6.1-litre HEMI V8 petrol engine developing 425PS and 560Nm. 0-100km/h could be covered within 5 seconds in this car! </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>And the Award Goes to...!</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the 2005 Motor Trend Car of the Year award \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/chrysler-300C-image-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.chryslerpedia.org</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler 300C was not just about V8 noises and muscle power. It was also one of the most awarded new cars in the market upon its launch. Among some of the accolades, it won the <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/05-cotyw/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">2005 Motor Trend Car of the Year award</a> while also making it to the &#39;Ten Best Cars&#39; list on Car and Driver magazine in 2005 and 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to that, it bagged the North American Car of the Year and Canadian Car of the Year Best New Luxury Car awards. Awards aside, the 300C also became a cult-car between 2005 and 2010. It was listed in the &quot;<strong>25 Most Iconic Hip-Hop Cars</strong>&quot; mainly because of its popularity among rappers. What&#39;s more, even Barack Obama, the current president of the US, had one in the mid-2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"darkText\"><em>Chrysler also offered the 300 models in right-hand drive versions in European markets. There was in fact a V6 diesel engine that was offered in addition to the V6 and V8 petrol engines in Europe.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Many may defy from this famously quoted line but definitely Big fishes in the automobile industry don&#39;t. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_GTO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pontiac GTO Judge Convertible</a> is one of the rarest but highly sort after muscle cars that could ever be made and the fact that there are only seventeen of these makes one cry their eyes out. GTO&#39;s were inspired by Ferrari and created as a next level deal from the Tempest league. The arrival of Judge took the racing as a foundation feature amongst muscles to whole new level. The car was every American Muscle fans dream but in 1971 when the pollution emission rules became way stricter the company decided to produce only 17 and stop further production.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>T4 Chevrolet Corvette L88</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"T4 Chevrolet Corvette L88\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Rarest-L88-Convertible.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: latestcarwallpapers.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>20 cars produced.</em></strong><br />\r\nIn 1967 and 1968 the people witnessed a glorious period because that was the year which saw the arrival of Corvette L88s. The factory in St. Louis was chosen to do the holy job of producing the Corvette L88. The reference to word &#39;holy&#39; is given since the car enthusiasts have never stopped worshipping the car ever since it was launched. The L88 was also a racing upgrade version by <a href=\"https://www.chevrolet.co.in/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chevrolet</a>. The Corvette got upgraded a few notch, a 427-cubic inch big block engine was added. It was definitely all a man could want for a ride. And the fact that Chevy thought it was a bit dangerous for the streets and discourage selling it through dealership also added the extra air of thrill to the car. But, Alas! The age old issues pertaining to emission also forced Chevy to stop producing the valuable 1967 L88&#39;s. What a sad turn of events. Nevertheless we still have the Corvette&#39;s which are no less than the others of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Plymouth Hemi Cuda Convertible</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Plymouth Hemi Cuda Convertible\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Rarest-Plymouth-Hemi-Cuda-Convertible.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: latestcarwallpapers.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>21 cars produced.</em></strong><br />\r\nIf ever there could be a car let alone a muscle which would get etched in our memory to such an extent that no one and absolutely nobody could wipe it off, it&#39;s Hemi Cuda. Plymouth came up with the idea in 1970 to redesign the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Barracuda\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Barracuda</a>. And later like the other brands a cool and much suave name came to be given to the Barracuda. People started referring it as Cuda. With an entire range of engines from 340 to 440, this was and has been hands down the most sought after muscle of all times where the 426 being the most favorite of all. The rarest of all, The Cuda Convertibles were the apple of all muscle lover&#39;s eyes. It is sad that the upgrade cost which would have been much higher caused Plymouth to stop the production after 21 cars.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Not only in a matter of hours the video becomes viral, it is talked about and featured almost everywhere. Car enthusiasts wait eagerly for any update and when that update comes in the form of a beautiful video nothing could get better than that. Be it a car launch, a car review or a drag race. When it comes to videos, accelerating cars are really exhilarating!</p>\r\n<p>Here is a list of videos that have been breaking the Internet in all the right sense.</p>\r\n<h2>Jaguar F-PACE</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jaguar F-PACE\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/0fcccca5b510e5bb86a94045046d252d_L.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>Automobiles are equal to horsepower! The most clich&eacute;d and stereotypical line we have ever heard and unfortunately believed to a certain extent. But Jaguar, being the creative brand it is, has broken all boundaries by making the Guinness World Record of creating a racetrack in the form of a 360 degree loop. An inspiration to not just the other supercar brands of its league but also mere mortals like us. The main aim behind this spectacular idea is to show that the all <a href=\"https://www.jaguar.in/jaguar-range/f-pace/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new F-Pace</a> defies all rules of gravity. Stunt Driver Terry Grant is not just the driver behind the wheels but also the first spectator of the super agile, super fast and super light F-Pace. Definitely without shame we feel some jealousy towards him. Watch the video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y64JhPtpicA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Ken Block's Gymkhana Eight</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ken Block's Gymkhana Eight\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/69b5f85da08d181d48515c6d41e3e0a5_L.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>Has it ever been so, that something has come into your notice which completely leaves you awe struck? Probably you have but then again this is on another level. Has it ever been so that you have witnessed something which has been so bizarre and so out of the world yet so exhilarating? Probably have but then again not as outstanding as this. This video of Gymkhana Eight is definitely class apart and tagging it as another car drift video would be completely unfair towards the video. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Block\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ken Block</a> is a man with a mission. He makes sure that you go all \"ooh!\" And \"aah!\" while watching the video. Mr. Block is a daredevil and surely not someone who would take the easier road, Hint: Driving across the mud pools. If you're still by any chance wondering why it is breaking the Internet then wait till Block drifts around the moving Boeing. Yes you heard it right; A MOVING BOEING. Watch the video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hf6ke1-i3E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>HYPER 5</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"HYPER 5\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/78a1f76203c562c3d7c318765865da44_L.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>We feel <a href=\"/sports\">Hypercars</a> are termed as \"Hypercars\" because they are supposed to make you all hyper. Well that's too many hypers in one sentence but then that's how one feels when one sees a Hypercar whether in real or in reel life. A mere sight of any hypercar get one all hyperventilating and here, in this brutal video we have got all five of the best Hypercars; <a href=\"https://auto.ferrari.com/en_EN/sports-cars-models/car-range/laferrari/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari LaFerrari</a> vs Porsche 918 vs McLaren P1 vs Bugatti Veyron Super Sport vs Pagani Huayra. These cars are the meanest, the baddest, the fastest and the most expensive production cost modern day Hypercars. We have all heard, read and learnt the famous theory of evolution by Darwin and definitely the evolution of Hypercars could be attributed to the competition amongst these big daddies of the world. And as for us, we just consider ourselves lucky enough to witness so much technological advancement that sitting at our homes we can watch videos of such big events (Surely bigger than any for a car enthusiast). And still if you feel the need to ask why this video is breaking the Internet, Go watch the video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNAh6dpBS40\">here</a>!</p>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>As much as we&rsquo;re such big fans of the 007, we all have to agree that Mr. Bond is not really a good MI5 agent. Why? Well, for one he&rsquo;s the least covert person in the world. 007 is famous and very well known not only to the lovely ladies all over, but also to every bartender knows him and even his order. A vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred. James Bond is more a celebrity than a spy. What&rsquo;s baffling is he doesn&rsquo;t tweet from his twitter account - Have my gun down a drug lord&rsquo;s throat, time for a martini! #BondLife</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a spy who loves to get the job done and in style, it&rsquo;s no wonder that Mr. Bond is very enthusiastic about what he drives to work. Although he is known to destroy everything he drives, just as his immortal charisma and charm, his cars too leave behind a certain legacy. It is surprising to see the kind of automotive weaponry the MI5 has made available to Mr. Bond, despite his destructive nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We bring you the Top 5 Big Guns (read: Cars) that 007 has driven over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BMW Z8 : The World is Not Enough</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW Z8 Bond Cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/BMW-Z8.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://https://cdn.bmwblog.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This beautiful, small <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\">convertible</a> was made by the German carmaker from 1999 to 2003. James Bond was its first customer, outside of the BMW factory, of course. Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in the movie The World is Not Enough, drove around in this little beauty. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Z8</a> got its thunder from the 5.0-liter V8 engine and had a 6-speed manual transmission. This car however was not very driver-friendly and thus rightly got sliced in half with a hacksaw in the movie. But nonetheless it is definitely a looker, every time it passes you by.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Toyota 2000GT : You Only Live Twice</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Toyota 2000GT Bond Cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Toyota-2000GT.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://https://www.car-revs-daily.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>What a beauty, isn&rsquo;t it? The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_2000GT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Toyota 2000GT</a> was a result of collaboration between two Japanese motor giants &ndash; Toyota and Yamaha. Sean Connery, playing Bond in You Only Live Twice, could not fit into this convertible, so two variants of this car were built just for the movie. Q, generous as ever with his modifications, added many Sony gadgets into the car, including a CCTV system, cameras fitted behind the number plate, voice-controlled entertainment system and a two-way radio. Daniel Craig once mentioned this to be his favorite Bond car.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Aston Martin V12 Vanquish : Die Another Day</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aston Martin V12 Vanquish Bond Cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Aston-Martin-V12-Vanquish.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://https://cdntbs.astonmartin.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s James Bond without his <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/aston-martin\"> Aston Martins</a>?&nbsp;After Bond got his clearance aka license to kill the bad guys in Die Another Day, he was given this car, which was nicknamed &lsquo;Vanish&rsquo;. The car had some of the trademark Bond modifications, such as machine guns, rockets, a reinforced chassis, but the most significant feature of this car was its cloaking ability, which made the car almost invisible with just the push of a button. The regular cars, available to the masses, were rear-wheel drive and featured a 5.9-liter V12 engine. But the one used in the movie was molded to gain better traction on ice and thus was fitted with a Ford 300bhp V8.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Aston Martin DB5 : Goldfinger / GoldenEye / Tomorrow Never Dies / Casino Royale</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aston Martin DB5 Casino Royale Bond Cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Aston-Martin-DB5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://https://cdn.pursuitist.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Aston Martin DB5</a> probably is the most popular Bond car around and has been in play over many Bond eras - from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig. Ian Fleming, author of the 007 series had visualized and written about Bond being in a DB3, but because at the time of Goldfinger, Aston Martin had come up with a brand new DB5, that was a no-brainer. This was the first Bond car to get modded-up by Q and initially had built-in just a smoke screen. However, to keep up with Mr. Bond&rsquo;s demanding job, many more gadgets had to be put in, such as a rotating number plate, machine guns and most importantly, an ejector seat. The gadgeting of this car back then cost &pound;25,000, which was about five times more than the actual price of the car. And it sure was worth it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>T-55 Russian Tank : GoldenEye</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"T-55 Russian Tank : GoldenEye\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/T-55-Russian-Tank.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://https://cdn.fansided.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no way we could not mention this beast from GoldenEye. Pierce Brosnan&rsquo;s first movie as James Bond and he is suddenly put behind the wheels of this tank. Driving a tank through St. Petersburg is just sheer Bond Bravado and thus makes our list.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t just go ahead and call any car <strong>&lsquo;The Best in the World&rsquo;</strong>. Its an exercise you undertake at your own risk. A car may be number 1 in certain areas but may fail to register in other aspects, where another car might perform better. Also, mega fast race cars are not useful for driving your family to the mall for a day out. Despite all of this, if any person, out of their minds or too drunk to tell left from right, has attempted to declare one car as The Best, the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw/5-series\">BMW 5-Series</a> has certainly made all of their shortlists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BMW 5-series is as close to perfect as a car can get, whether be its looks, features or performance. This car&rsquo;s excellent overall run over the years has made it a benchmark that other <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">luxury sedans</a> must try and overtake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we bring you the evolution of the BMW 5-Series over decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>First Generation (1972 - 1981) E12</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"First Generation (1972 - 1981) E12\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/First-Generation.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.carwallpapers.cc</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first generation of the BMW 5-Series ran from 1972 to 1981. The car had a 103.8 inch wheelbase and the overall length was 181.9 inch. In the first gen 5-series, only a 2.0 liter engine was offered, which gave the car a 125hp. This engine was underpowered, compared to the other cars in its category, which is why it was not launched and marketed in the US before 1975. The first generation 5-series was just sold in Europe. But that did not stop this car from going on to become a success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Second Generation (1982 - 1988) E28</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Second Generation (1982 - 1988) E28\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Second-Generation.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://slammedia.net</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a class act is never easy and that&rsquo;s exactly what happened here. BMW designers made just minor changes to this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series#E28_.281982.E2.80.931987.29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">second generation 5-series</a>. Some say it was too minor to even tell a First Gen from a Second Gen. The most evident change that could be seen in this installment was the rear of the car, wherein the fender benders as well as the lid of the trunk stood high. Apart from these, one other significant change was the use of newer construction materials for the body and modern techniques, which made the car 132-200 pounds lighter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Third Generation (1989 - 1996) E34</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Third Generation (1989 - 1996) E34\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Third-Generation.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://i.ytimg.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 5-series design was starting to look old-fashioned now, having run its course over a couple of decades and the folks at BMW realized that. This is why the third generation 5-series had a complete design overhaul. This was a brand new car that was now introduced. This car had a wheelbase of 108.7 inches, had spacious interiors, a state of the art suspension, all of which made this a hugely popular car, with its elegance, performance and comfort. This was the version that made a mark in the automotive world and people started considering it as one of the best cars around. These cars were powered by 3.0 liter 32-valve V8 engines, giving it a 215hp. Alternatively, a 4.0 liter V8 engine was offered for the power hungry drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fourth Generation (1997 - 2003) E39</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Fourth Generation (1997 - 2003) E39\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Fourth-Generation.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.automotivereviewsites.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This car was a little wider and bigger in every respect. Sitting on a 111.4 inch wheelbase, the suspension system installed in this car were lightweight alloys, rather than being of steel, which reduced the weight of the car further. These featured a 6-cylinder engine, which raced this car with a whooping 282bhp. The fourth generation also had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series_%28F10%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Motorsport Edition</a>&nbsp;that had a 5.0 liter V8 engine, boosting it to a humongous 392bhp.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fifth Generation (2004 - Present)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Fifth Generation (2004 - Present)\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Five-Generation.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.wallpaperup.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest change that the 5-series underwent was technologically. This is the 5-series that we see inside the showrooms and on the roads mostly, today. With a complete look overhaul, this car is acknowledged for its mechanical prowess. Yet another example of the 5-series outgrowing and overtaking its <a href=\"https://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/5series/overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">legacy cars</a>. Now this beast sits on a wheelbase of 113.7 inches and stretches to 190.6 inches, making it the most spacious and roomier 5-series till date. The diesel version is the most popular variant and even that runs very quiet, making it ideal for everyday usage. This car holds a lot of value and prestige as its primary contenders, plus the running costs are fairly low. Think you&rsquo;ve got your perfect car!</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

These engines are harmful for the environment, as well as the car&rsquo;s performance, arguably. Both of these problems are being taken seriously by the car manufacturers and they are undertaking the challenge and doing all they can to make things right. This year at the Geneva Motor Show, a lot of Green Concept Cars were featured that solved the age-old dependence on oil, while keeping the performance and power at par, if not more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we bring you the Top 3 Green Concept <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">Supercars</a>&nbsp;from the Geneva Motor Show:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Italdesign GTZero</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Italdesign GTZero\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Italdesign-GTZero.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.zerotohundred.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.italdesign.it/en/topics/ginevra-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GTZero</a> displayed at the <a href=\"https://www.salon-auto.ch/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Geneva Motor Show </a>was an electric yellow one. This car claims to have a range of 500kms, which means you don&rsquo;t need to worry about running out of batteries mid-journey. What&rsquo;s better is its batteries take lesser time to charge than a cellphone, getting an 80% charge in just 30mins. Quite impressive!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GTZero&rsquo;s three electric motors give it a whooping power of 483hp and although there has not been an official 0-100km/h announcement, we can only imagine what it would be like. This car features a modular design, which means that if you don&rsquo;t like the style of the body, the front and rear can be completely overhauled and replaced to suit different car styles. Other variations include a better battery or even a fuel cell! The GTZero also features a four-wheel drive and even a four-wheel steering.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pininfarina H2 Speed</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Pininfarina H2 Speed\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Pininfarina-H2-Speed.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.zerotohundred.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve seen a Pininfarina before, this car is very much in line with the trademark Pininfarina style. The H2 Speed is a supercar that was built with a vision of an environment-friendly car that does not compromise on performance at the racetracks. This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sporty car</a> runs on a revolutionary hydrogen fuel-cell tech and its two electric motors give it the power of about 500hp. A rear-wheel drive, the H2 Speed goes from 0-100km/h in a stunning 3.4 seconds, with a top speed of 300km/h. This car takes 3 minutes to refuel, which is much lesser than it takes to refuel your car at a gas station.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Techrules AT96 TREV</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Techrules AT96 TREV\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Techrules-AT96-TREV.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.zerotohundred.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This car claims to be the first supercar coming out of China. Given the high smog and haze levels in the country, the TREV&rsquo;s engine is fitting for the Chinese atmosphere. The engine of this car is the same that is installed in fighter jets - a Turbine Engine, giving it a maximum power of a steep 1030bhp. The vehicle claims of 0-100km/h in 2.5 seconds with a top speed of 350km/h. Now comes the part you&rsquo;ve been waiting for - the fuel consumption. The TREV consumes just 0.18L/100km, despite the Turbine Engine being an internal combustion engine. If that&rsquo;s not environment-friendly, we don&rsquo;t know what else is. At present most cars use an electric plug-in or range-extender paired with an internal combustion engine, for sharing the load or to charge the batteries. The turbine system is a first for any car and if proven to be successful, will surely be used in many other models.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Hypercars themselves are some kind of god amongst the cars of the same league. They are much talked about and even more admired. While to some they seem &lsquo;a bit over the top&rsquo; and &lsquo;over board&rsquo; but to many Hypercars are mysterious and have a some kind of air of ambiguity around them despite the jaw dropping specifications each has. This may be attributed to the fact that Hypercars as a term is relatively latest in the history of automobile. But over the period of time all of us have come to attribute immense horsepower, mind blowing specs and out of this world performance with Hypercars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pagani&rsquo;s and The Bugatti&rsquo;s of this world have become synonyms for the term &lsquo;Hypercar&rsquo; and recently we saw <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> stepping up the game by venturing into this line of cars in the<a href=\"https://www.salon-auto.ch/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Geneva Motor Show</a>. But the question still remains that even after seeing and knowing the Ferrari&rsquo;s, Pagani&rsquo;s and Bugatti&rsquo;s of the world, have we known all the Hypercars that exist? Well as much as we wouldn&rsquo;t want it to, the answer is a NO.<em class=\"redText\"> The most badass Hypercars, The underdogs or the The Mafias, as we call them, are yet undiscovered as the other heroes of their league.</em> We oblige you with a list of such badass Mafia Hypercars in this article, after all they deserve the much needed attention and we deserve the much needed information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Devel Sixteen</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Devel Sixteen\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/The-Devel-Sixteen.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.caricos.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The name says it all. It&rsquo;s a sheer devil of a car or should we say Hypercar. Devel, as we know, is a Dubai based company and Dubai, as everyone knows, is known for its extravagant love for luxury which surely sees no boundaries or limitations. <a href=\"https://devel-sixteen.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Devel Sixteen</a> is definitely the Mafia amongst hypercars. This isn&rsquo;t a question but a statement and if someone dare ask why then the straightforward answer is 5000 bhp. YES! No need to pop those eyes out in amazement. 5000 bhp is the what this Devil Devel has. Although being the car enthusiast you are, you must have guessed but let&rsquo;s just put it right in front that to support the exceptionally mind blowing 5000 bhp&rsquo;s this beast has a V16 engine. All in all, other than the lack of adjectives to describe this beast, everything is far more than perfect!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Laraki Epitome</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Laraki Epitome\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Laraki-Epitome.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.caricos.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting their legacy from Morocco, Yes that dreamy beautiful city, Laraki automobiles has come a long way. Popularly known as the ultimate brand that built out-of-this-world-extraordinary Yacht. As it is Yacht make us go all dreamy and bring out the traveller that lies low inside us and here they are making the world&#39;s best luxurious Yachts. This fact itself defines that there isn&rsquo;t any need to question their luxury quotient. Pebble Beach Concours d&rsquo;Elegance 2013 saw the launch of Laraki&rsquo;s Epitome. One look at the Epitome and it leaves you wondering where have you seen something similar. There is a lot of discussion that this beauty somewhat resemble a &ldquo;Batmobile and a plane&rdquo; combined together. Whosoever it resembles, it sure is a one hell of a Hypercar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mazzanti Evantra</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mazzanti Evantra\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Mazzanti-Evantra.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.caricos.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We know it is a Supercar and we know this article is all about Hypercars but the mention of this beauty was essential. Luca Mazzanti and Walter Faralli the forefathers of this Luxury car company, established the entire empire in the year 2000. Sounds recent hence why it has been undermined up until now. Only produced in very limited number; somewhere around five units per year, This Evantra the hypercar from Mazzanti is definitely one of the rarest and one of the most desirable Hypercar. Many aren&rsquo;t aware that Evantra is a tailor made hypercar by Mazzanti. It&rsquo;s hyper and exclusive in all the sense one could make of.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The motor beasts of the yesteryears were from the start built differently from today&rsquo;s modern vehicles. The human element that went into manufacturing these beauties exuded that very thing through their metal bodies, beastly muscle and unbeatable elegance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With time however the shine wears off the bodies and the muscle starts to mellow down, and it&#39;s time for these cars to go to the junkyard, right? Well, not quite. Car restoration enthusiasts and professionals take on the task of injecting new life into these vehicles so they can drive around the town for a decade more. However, restoring a decade-old car is a cumbersome task, not to mention expensive, given the availability of parts, etc. Even if one chooses to do the entire job on their own, the cost of the restoration will easily run into 5-figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We bring to you our favorite three restored beauties that are sure to knock the daylights out of you:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"famous and desirous for curvy cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/buick_streamliner.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.adriantiba.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one car that&rsquo;s curvy enough to become a muse to any restoration artist and maybe even poets and artists too. Just the mere look of this car puts today&rsquo;s slim and slick cars to shame. Coming from an era that was famous and desirous for curvy cars, the body is made of pure aluminum, on a steel chassis. Although it is very unlikely that you&rsquo;ll spot one of these on the roads or even at an auction, a car like this is worth keeping an eye out for.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"curvy car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Ferrari-166mm.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.luxcars.ch/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This was one of the first cars that put <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> on the map as a respectable sports car maker. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barchetta\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Barchetta</a> was found in Italy, tucked away in a barn before it was spotted byan enthusiast and then purchased for a mere $8,000. This car&rsquo;s lightweight body made this a prominent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sports car</a> for Ferrari, add to that a V12 engine, with a power of 140 horses. This car exudes an original race car feel to the onlookers and not to forget the famous names that drove this beauty - Alberto Ascari and Luigi Chinetti included. As of date, this is one of the most discussed and most popular cars at any vintage car shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the most-desired Lamborghinis\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lamborginisfeghwefki.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.italianautonews.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Miura\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Miura Roadster</a> too was found in an Italian barn and it is safe to say it is one of the biggest discoveries ever made, right alongside the discovery of oil. Well, at least to car lovers it is. This car never went into a mass production and was intended just as a promotional for Lamborghini, thus only a very few cars were made between 1966 and 1972, making it one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">most-desired Lamborghinis</a> in the world today. After 40 years later, this car was purchased by a New Yorker in the year 2007 and restored to its original 1968 condition.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>According to every <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog\">car enthusiast</a>, every luxury car is a star in his eyes and an object of admiration for life. For a car enthusiast, if you ask which luxury car you love the most is as tough a question as which luxury car you hate the most. This is because on one hand the list of supercars they love the most is never ending, whereas, on the other hand, finding the disliked ones or for that matter the supercars you hate is next to impossible. Car enthusiasts we can say are peace loving people; &ldquo;Love all. Hate None.&rdquo; Nevertheless over the decades we have seen supercars failing to gain the kind of popularity that other cars of their league gained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to clear the air, we must understand one fact that the particular word &ldquo;flop&rdquo; when it comes to the automobile industry cannot be treated as synonym with a low performance car. There are several and when we say several we mean truckloads of reasons that lead to the sinking of any car launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here is the list of the most heartbreaking <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">luxury cars</a> that couldn&rsquo;t fly high!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the most heartbreaking luxury cars \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/vector-super.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://i.ytimg.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>They came with a bang and for sure with an aim. The aim was plain and simple; to produce cost effective American supercars. They wanted to be the philanthropists of the supercar industry. Why would there be line between who can and who cannot afford it. If it&#39;s a supercar, it&rsquo;s for all is what they thought. Such a brilliant thought but then what went wrong? Why was it that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_W8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Vector W8</a> couldn&rsquo;t achieve what it set out for? Maybe it was the outlandish look or the fact that it was supposed to be affordable planted an altogether different perception in the people&rsquo;s mind. No wonder the first customer appeared almost after nine year of booking the car. Yes, Bizarre and Sad!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Chryslerâ€™s TC by Maserati \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Chrysler-TC-by-Maserati.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://images.hgmsites.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah we know you are feeling completely baffled by reading the name itself. Wait till you get to know what happened. It was Lee Iacocca&#39;s brainchild and was supposed to shoot like a rocket. The alliance was perfect, the man behind the idea was&hellip; well let&#39;s not go there; the specifications of the car weren&rsquo;t as bad as it seems. But then what really happened? Well as they say ignorance happened and also arrogance happened. People said it was over priced with obviously the appearance coming off as a bad gimmick of the age old design. It was over hyped and over discussed. Frankly the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_TC_by_Maserati\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chrysler&rsquo;s TC by Maserati</a> was like that same old pack of frozen food that tasted bad always but with a miserably fancy packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"an SUV out of a pick-up\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/GMC-Envoy-XUV.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.allautoexperts.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Like all the others which didn&rsquo;t quite work out, the plan looked brilliant on the paper. With a movable roof this was supposed to be one-of-a-kind <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUV</a>. But when did someone say that things go as per the plan? And specially when you set out to make a pick-up out of an SUV or was it making an SUV out of a pick-up? See, this is exactly what went wrong. History has told and in detail proved again and again that whenever the brands have tried to attain a lot of things all at once they have backfired. Well people let&rsquo;s just stick to good old Horsepower in bulk and style that drops jaw!</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

When it has to come to the point where we are accepting, let&#39;s just say we have been a lot biased towards car enthusiasts. We know how tremendously hurt, confused and dazed the newbies in the car lover&#39;s gang felt. So here we are making up for it. Yes! You peeps out there trying to find their way through supercars, hypercars, Bhp&#39;s and torques, we have something for your.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually in a very enthusiastic tone, we are either busy describing a latest Supercar/Hypercar or busy giving analogies as to why it&#39;s the best. But here we are today to break things into their smallest form. Here we are to tell you the best Supercars of the world every newbie in car crazy gang must know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS: This article should be treated as your alma mater. Everything you learn here will help you grow your interest in <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a> and understand in depth the level of crazy love all car enthusiasts have for the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ferrari 488 GTB</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ferrari 488 GTB\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/ferrari-488-gtb.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.caranddriver.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If someone asks you about your dream car and all that you can say is &quot;<strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">I love Ferrari</a></strong>&quot; and then you reply with only &quot;ya ya&#39;s&quot; to high-end specs that your friend is telling about; you definitely need to continue reading further. They say it is one of the best and the most stunning supercars ever. Launched on 3rd of February, 2015, <a href=\"https://auto.ferrari.com/en_EN/sports-cars-models/car-range/ferrari-488-gtb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari 488 GTB</a> has been a worldwide hit ever since. A mind blowing 661 Horsepower, what could one ask for other than this? And then after all it is FERRARI! Sure just the name itself is enough to make you go all weak in the knees. The specs are just few things that make it a great car. Since you are a newbie, all that you need to know is that it is god among <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">all the supercars</a></strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lamborghini Huracan</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini Huracan\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/lamborghini-huracan.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://carsicons.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>For people who don&#39;t really know in depth about supercars, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lamborghini</a> and Ferrari are like synonyms for fast cars. Yes Lamborghini is fast indeed, but it is definitely much more and definitely not a synonym for Ferrari *Rivalry Alert*. Huracan is really like a Hurricane when it rolls down the road. Its sound itself gives everyone around a &quot;supercar on the way&quot; warning. A massive beast is what you can call it. It is like a devil with angel&#39;s wings. 600 horsepower is among other things that make it one of the best supercars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS: check out head to head races with other supercars to know the real power of this beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bugatti Veyron La Finale</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bugatti Veyron La Finale\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/bugatti-veyron-la-finale.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.luxuo.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If supercars had a country of their own then Bugatti would have been their President in every single term. Yes it is that good. One look at it and you know it&#39;s one hundred percent true. The ever <a href=\"https://www.bugatti.com/veyron/veyron-164-grand-sport-vitesse/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Veyron</a> to be built was this La Finale. Why we haven&#39;t posted the Veyron but it&#39;s last car to be produced is because we wanted to show the best of bests. And my friends, La Finale was definitely the best of all Veyrons. As famously quoted &quot;It&#39;s a pack of 1000 horses under the hood&quot;, This Veyron version is definitely the one you should dream, breathe and live and also buy a poster and paste it on your wall.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>It takes a lot of courage and guts to get to compiling a list such as this. The World over, many such lists have been attempted but then they ignited big controversies. Racing fanatics believe Racing to be their religion and the Drivers, their Gods. So an exclusion of one&#39;s favorite driver from any list comprising of &#39;Best Drivers&#39; is considered a very serious offence, and people have time and again voice out their opinions. Especially on passionate subjects such as this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drivers here are not shortlisted on the basis of Championships won or Victories bagged. It&#39;s about passion. Yes, winning is a big part of the game, but more than that, it is the passion that the drivers bring to their races and passion, the fans can see in their eyes and in their driving, leading them to worship their idols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is, according to us, a list of the Top 3 Race Car drivers:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alain Prost</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Alain Prost\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Alain-prost.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.youtube.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Topping the list is the French race car driver Alain Prost. He has four Formula 1 championships under his belt. Michael Schumacher is the only one who has overtaken him in terms of number of titles won. Alain Prost was the driver with the record number of Grand Prix wins between 1987 to 2001. He earned the nickname of &#39;The Professor&#39; because of his intellectual perspective towards racing. One of his well-known strategies was not burning in his tyres and brakes in the initial laps of the race, but saving them for an all-out challenge in the finishing laps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nigel Mansell</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Nigel Mansell\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Nigel-Mansell.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.iran-daily.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>No driver has been known to have fought as fiercely as Nigel Mansell to get into Formula 1 racing. And surely, no one has ever fought as hard as him to stand his ground. With statistics of 31 Wins, along with 32 Crashes, Mansell was extremely focused, aggressive and a daring driver, who wasn&#39;t scared of pushing the limits. He is considered to be one of the most famous drivers hailing from the United Kingdom. He won both the Formula 1 Championship of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a> as well as the Indycar World Series, the latter being his debut season of Cart racing. Mansell is the only <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">racing car</a> driver to hold both the titles together.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dale Earnhardt</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Dale Earnhardt\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Dale-Earnhardt.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://kzok.cbslocal.com//</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Better known as &#39;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Earnhardt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Intimidator</a>&#39;, Earnhardt was famous for his NASCAR career. He is undoubtedly one of the best NASCAR drivers, hands down. With a total of 76 Winston Cup victories under his belt, Earnhardt also won 7 <strong><a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/champions-week-2018-offseason\">NASCAR Championships</a></strong>, including one in Daytona 500. He earned his nickname of &#39;The Intimidator&#39; because of his fiercely aggressive style of driving. In 2001, Dale Earnhardt got into a crash at Daytona 500, which resulted in serious injury to his skull, ultimately leading to a tragic death. Following that he has been inducted into many Halls of Fame.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The simple fact is that this world has seen so many legendary racers that it is difficult to cover all of them at once and highly unfair to leave anyone of them. Racing out of all the sports is the most aspirational one for its audience. To be there on the track and to be able to drive a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">racecar</a> so fast that it makes you skip the beat and brings the heart into your mouth, this crazy dream is lived by many but achieved by only a few. These all-time legendary racers leave a legacy of their own and inspire so many to become so much more. In our last article, we gave you a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/the-best-racers-of-all-times\">list of the best racers</a>. So here we have again for you people the best racers of all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Revel in their glory, my friends, Revel in their glory! </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Richard Petty</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Richard-Petty\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Richard-Petty.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.sportingnews.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody knew him as &#39;King&#39; and why wouldn&#39;t they, after all, he was the king amongst all the racers. A former <strong><a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/\">NASCAR</a></strong> driver who raced in Grand National Era, Perry was amongst the most famous and most loved racers of all time. Winning the NASCAR Championship for seven times was his most accounted and celebrated achievement. He is in terms of statistics, the most famous and accomplished driver. All in all, he bagged 200 wins amongst which Daytona 500 for seven times was a significant part.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jimmie Johnson</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jimmie-Johnson\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Jimmie-Johnson-.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.sportingnews.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The name recited after Petty&#39;s is that of Jimmie Kenneth Johnson. An American stock car racing driver, he won the <a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/en_us/sprint-cup-series.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">NASCAR</a> for six times. Came to fame by winning his first; 2006 NASCAR, he is known by the No. 48 Chevrolet, he races with. He too bagged Daytona 500 but only twice. Among other accolades, Johnson is the first driver to have been a part of Associated Press Male Athlete Of The Year in 2009 along with being the Driver Of The Year twice in his racing career. And then yes, the Forbes most influential athlete list where Johnson too got featured. All in all, in such a short time Jammie Johnson shot to fame and has maintained it like no other.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mario Andretti</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mario-Andretti\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Mario-Andretti.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.youtube.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The hot shot Italian racer! The ideal one amongst all the others. Mario Gabriele Andretti was an Italian American world championship racer. One the most famous in the history of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sports car</a> racing, Mario made his spot in the racing world like nobody else could ever dream of making. He is one of the only two drivers in this world who have won the Formula one, IndyCar, World Sportscar championship and yes, of course, NASCAR. His greatness, of course, doesn&#39;t end there. He till date remains the only driver to win Indianapolis 500, Daytona 500, <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Formula one championship</a> and also, the Juan Pablo Montoya. The fact that he was the only person who was named the United States Driver Of The Year tells us the kind of career he had. And surely it wasn&#39;t anything less than historical.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

In our eyes, those who worship cars like us and treat them like a family are greater beings. Getting inspired from the same, all of us have begged as kids to get the scaled models and make our very own collection. The kid next block whose dad brought that Mercedes scaled model was the most famous of all while all the others contented themselves with the miniatures they bought from regular shops. And then came the HOT WHEELS. The god of all car racing collectibles. The cars, the tracks and the fun, it wasn&#39;t just any other car collectible, it was everything a young car enthusiast has ever wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relationship of Men and Cars seems to run deep. And why not? As they say, &quot;Without the rain there would be no rainbow&quot;. Without our obsession for hot wheels, we would not have been fascinated by <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">the real luxury cars</a>. Most of us already have a substantial collection of these cars, tucked away in some corner of our houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1968 White Enamel Camaro ($2,500+)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"1968 White Enamel Camaro\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/1968-White-Enamel-Camaro.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.69pace.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This car was probably the first Hot Wheels produced by Mattel in 1968. It is a very rare find and you&#39;re most likely not going to find one very easily, let alone one in a sealed pack. Evident from the fact that this car is the third rarest Hot Wheels car to exist. Although not one of the flashier hot wheels that were made, but this was a true representation of what the guys at Mattel were trying to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1968 Custom Volkswagen without Sunroof</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"1968 Custom Volkswagen without Sunroof\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/1968-Volkswagen-without-Sunroof.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This was a replica of the US Custom <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/volkswagen\">Volkswagens</a>, these were made in Hong-Kong around 1968. Available to customers all over the European continent, the majority of sales were in Germany and the UK. Most of these came with a Blue body, with the exception of a few Aqua, Orange and Yellow ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1970 Ed Shaver Custom AMX</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"1970 Ed Shaver Custom AMX\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/1970-Ed-ShaverCustom-AMX.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://blog.livedoor.jp/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This Ed Shaver AMX was another rare favorite, which was exclusively made for sale in the UK. Only ever produced in Blue, it was a replica of Ed Shaver&#39;s racecar. Mattel sponsored Shaver, with the company decals on his <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">racecar</a>, this replica Hot Wheels were sold at the racetracks wherever he used to race. A part of the &quot;Exclusive Racing Car Series&quot; pack, this is undoubtedly one of the most popular die-cast replica to have ever been produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2008 Diamond-Encrusted Custom Otto ($140,000)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"2008 Diamond-Encrusted Custom Otto\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/2008-Diamond-Encrusted-Custom-Otto.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://ultimatehotwheels.boards.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mattel, in 2008, wanted to get a tad bit flashy, to show the world just how huge the <a href=\"https://hotwheels.wikia.com/wiki/History_of_Hot_Wheels\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Wheels brand</a> had become over the years. For this mission, Jason Arasheben, a celebrity jeweler was brought in to make a showstopper car for their 40th business anniversary. And Jason did come through with about 2,000 multi-colored diamonds studded on the entire body of the car. An extensive project that took about 600 hours to complete, but was completely worthwhile.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

We always want to achieve great heights in our life and for that we do hard labor and work intensively. But among all these hassles what are we missing? Yes, you guessed it right! We always forget to add some spices to our lives to make it more interesting, lively, thrilling and full of fun and what's more better than cruising the road at the deafening speed and that too in the superfast supercar? Sounds good to ears? It seems like somebody has revived the feelings that were hidden somewhere around the corner of our heart.</p>\r\n<p>Sleek, classy and fast, the <a href=\"/sports\">supercars</a> with enthralling and electrifying speed are capable enough of sending chill down your spine and the throttling sound of engine will undoubtedly give you an adrenaline rush. Representing the finest example of refined human engineering, these superfast beasts have all the power to make you go weak in the knees. The fever for being behind the wheels of these super wild cars is so high that many have risked their lives to experience the taste of speed whereas few, who succeeded in building a special place for themselves in this arena, have sacrificed their lives in chasing these superlatives. Popular among them are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ayrton Senna</a>, the famous Formula One Racer, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Walker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paul Walker</a>, the highly admired American actor well-known for his role in the celebrated series &ndash; Fast and Furious. Both the figures have earned respect in their own fields but one thing they share in common is their love for speed and supercars.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"If one day speed kills me, don't cry, because I was smiling\" &ndash; Paul Walker</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"Racing, competing, it's in my blood. It's part of me, it's part of my life.\" &ndash; Ayrton Senna</em></p>\r\n<p>Well, one cannot deny the high risk of life involved in this game, but staying away from this sport is like snatching away the reason to live. Ranked amongst <a href=\"/collection\">the most expensive cars</a> of the world, these superfast beauties are not everyone's cup of tea as you need a big pocket to own one.</p>\r\n<p>Speed and acceleration go hand in hand but in reality both are treated differently. Where some rank superfast cars according to their top speed, others are of the view that it is the acceleration that is the deciding factor. Recently, Hennessey Venom GT Spyder has been introduced as the <a href=\"/car-news/meet-the-world-s-fastest-convertible-hennessey-venom-gt-spyder\">world's fastest convertible car;</a> however, we will not confuse you and let you decide your own standard for judging the fastest car of the world. To make it easier for you, we have provided the required facts and figures related to the speed, acceleration and time.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Vehicle manufacturers today have gone easy and soft on SUVs and most of the Offroaders and pickup trucks have started to prioritize more on fuel efficiency and rider comfort, as opposed to off-road ruggedness. And that makes sense too, for majority of the customers. But true offroaders live to experience the bumps and a drive through muddy waters. There are plenty of those too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We bring you a few such 4x4s that do not compromise the authenticity of a truck, with you not having to worry about taking the road less travelled:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Hard Rock Edition</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Hard Rock Edition\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Jeep-Wrangler-Rubicon-Hard-Rock.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://kevinspocket.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This beautiful, small <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\">convertible</a> was made by the German carmaker from 1999 to 2003. James Bond was its first customer, outside of the BMW factory, of course. Pierce Brosnan, who played James Bond in the movie The World is Not Enough, drove around in this little beauty. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The BMW&nbsp;Z8</a> got its thunder from the 5.0-liter V8 engine and had a 6-speed manual transmission. This car however was not very driver-friendly and thus rightly got sliced in half with a hacksaw in the movie. But nonetheless it is definitely a looker, every time it passes you by.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Toyota Land Cruiser</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Toyota Land Cruiser\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Toyota-Land-Cruiser.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://bestcarmag.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Very few <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUVs</a> have gone on to become synonymous with 4WD off road driving. The Toyota Land Cruiser is one such name. Over time, the Land Cruiser has become bigger in terms of size, price of the vehicle and also the in-car features. Be that as it may, the engineers at Toyota have never let the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/toyota/land-cruiser\">Land Cruiser</a> lose its off road capabilities. With a V8 engine giving it a 381hp, the Land Cruiser almost flies over even the worst terrain. And the best part about this is that the fuel efficiency is not at all that bad, with a 34.9mpg on its 3.0-Liter combined fuel engine. This is a real tough guy, built to withstand the extremes and also powerful enough to drive you out of any hostile and cruel environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes-Benz G500</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz G500\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/MercedesBenz-g-500.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.boldride.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally intended and designed for the defense forces around 1970, <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/passenger-cars/g-class/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> the G500</a> is still true to its roots even after decades. It definitely is a modern luxury Mercedes, with all the glitter and glamour and class. But underneath all of the leather, radar cruise control and wood, this one is totally old-school. This SUV can be considered as solid as a Tank, but then on the streets the story is different. To sum it up, if you&#39;re a UN peacekeeper in the African continent or in the military, you shouldn&#39;t think too much if you can afford to get a pass into the luxury club. But for regular everyday-use, the G500 falls short and feels compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mahindra Thar</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mahindra Thar\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Mahindra-thar.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.youtube.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mahindrathar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Mahindra Thar</a> is probably the most prominent and iconic SUVs/Trucks to have prowled the street of India. Brought into production in 2010, the Thar has kept its rugged off roader feel alive, in fact focusing more on its off road capabilities than fuel economy, luxury or comfort. Mahindra has been a major player in the SUV industry, with its cars on the roads from big cities to small villages. The Thar was introduced as a Cult car, with the intention of attracting the off road fanatics and hardcore drivers, who are more interested in driving off the road than on it.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The company keeps bringing these hot toys every year to tempt us and make us drool over and push us to updating our collection. <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a></strong> is not just a brand name; it actually is &#39;alter ego of elegance&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Mercedes is not just a toy to decorate your garages, it is meant to be making people sigh on the driver&#39;s fortune and one of such models is Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe. This remarkably chic <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUV</a> demands special attention and there is only way to do that &ndash; &#39;savor it through driving&#39;.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>Let&#39;s start breaking down this marvelous creation&#39;s driving experience one by one.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Luxury is its second name</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Image-2---2016-Mercedes-Benz-GLE-Coupe-exterior.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.caricos.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>From the moment you open the door till you buckle up yourself, Luxury exudes from every corner of the car. Since this is Mercedes and you can&#39;t allow yourself to think anything lesser; the company strives hard to maintain its rapport in the market. The company uses nothing but the best to manufacture a complete package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Everything feels plush and significant, and you can sense that no compromise was made in terms of quality of materials and lavishness. The moment you shut the door and sit comfortably and suit up for a smooth drive, you feel like you have definitely signed up for a majestic tour and nothing less. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Every pore of the car is packed with hi-tech technology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Being technologically advanced comes really easy to <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes cars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/class/class-GLE/bodystyle-CPE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GLE Coupe</a> definitely lives up to the expectation. This coupe can practically drive itself. Well, not literally as it is one step away from self driving. However, the hi-tech features like adaptive cruise control work amazingly well and really take the driving burden off your shoulders especially on the highways and traffic jams.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Luxurious GLE Coupe extravagant interior\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Image-3---2016-Mercedes-Benz-GLE-Coupe-interior.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.surf4cars.co.za/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>With activated adaptive cruise control, you can relax and watch the magic happen right in front of your eyes. You can take your hands off the wheel and let this amazing feature take all the control of the car. The car will drive itself; accelerate, decelerate and even drive perfectly through the corners of the roads. However, if it doesn&#39;t feel your hands on the wheel for a longer time, then it sends warning (that&#39;s why we said it&#39;s just one step away from autonomous driving). In case a car cuts you off suddenly, then the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/coupe\">coupe</a> comes to a complete halt saving you from any crashing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Another interesting feature is lane assist, which works bit too aggressively (feels like you are sitting with your mom, who keeps stopping and correcting you at every point). Even when you know that you don&#39;t need any help, the feature still does its work. Well, this can be bit annoying and takes bit of practice to get used to it (but hey, after all it&#39;s your safety and Mercedes can never compromise on that part).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other hi-tech features like blind spot detection, collision prevention assist, hill-start assist, attention assist, an adaptive suspension, active parking assist, cross-wind assist all of them scream out the car is way advanced than its other contenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Plush interior along with amazing infotainment system</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Luxurious GLE Coupe comes with an extravagant interior\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Image-4---Dashboard-of-2016-Mercedes-Benz-GLE-Coupe.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://auto-geil.de/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Luxurious GLE Coupe comes with an <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/class/class-GLE/bodystyle-CPE#waypoint=design\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">extravagant interior</a> that tempts you enough to sit and drive it home right away, without giving it a second thought. Smooth and precise wheel feels muscular in all the right places. Super comfortable adjustable seats make your driving stress-free and easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes is laced with a very sophisticated <a href=\"https://www.mbusa.com/vcm/MB/DigitalAssets/pdfmb/comandmanual/2010/MY10-E-Sedan-Coupe.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">COMAND infotainment system</a>, which is not a touchscreen but promises a fun-filled drive to you. This user-friendly infotainment system has a rotary scroll wheel that works really well with smartphones. GLE&#39;s cabin gives you a rich feeling along with a quiet surrounding. It&#39;s almost zero noise inside and gives you a peace of mind while driving devoid of all the distractions and outside roughness. Just, sit back and enjoy your drive!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It is capable of Off-Roading</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s quite unusual to see many GLE drivers taking their coupe to some expedition in the mountains or rough woods, but this SUV is definitely capable of giving you a great off-roading treat. Its adjustable suspension provides more ground clearance and you get complete traction with its all-wheel drive capability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>It has an interesting feature called &#39;Hill Descent Control&#39; that promises to give you a wonderful time while off-roading. This amazing feature modulates the brakes and maintains a balance while going down to the steep road. Its 360-degree camera offers a complete view in order to make you more attentive and alert.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you love frequent voyages in the rough roads of hilly areas then don&#39;t hesitate to choose this spectacular piece of perfection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&#39;s Fast and Furious</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Fast and Furious\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Image-5---2016-Mercedes-Benz-GLE-Coupe-engine.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.caricos.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">Its turbo 3.0L V6 powers up the coupe to satisfy your inner speed junkie really well. According to the company, the GLE Coupe can go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, which is pretty awesome. Its nine-speed transmission can make this SUV too powerful to fly on the road without any hitches. The engine pumps out impressive 362-HP and even in comfort mode you might feel like you are running out of roads because of its more than enough acceleration. So, our suggestion is, if you are faint-hearted then stay out of this SUV&#39;s way.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So, did we like the Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hell Yeah! <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/gle-450-amg-coupe-now-available-in-india\">The 2016 Mercedes-Benz GLE 450 AMG Coupe</a> is not everybody&#39;s cup of tea. This SUV belongs to a classy and niche segment, people who know and understand the true meaning of luxury. GLE stands out because of its unimaginable grandeur and technological marvel. It has everything you ever dreamt of, its compact family SUV that will always compliment your style with its never-fading charming personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, go grab your very own Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe NOW!</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>The 2002 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show#2002\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Geneva Motor Show</a> among the many marvels revealed a Phaeton to the world. Volkswagen aims to launch an all-electric version of the car this year. This car is the baby of Ferdinand Piech, who is also the chairman of the Volkswagen Group. Piech wanted to compete against premium brands such as <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a>, Mercedes, Audi, etc. through the Phaeton concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Commendable Features!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Piech was adamant that the car have the following features on it -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A speed limit of 300 km/hour. He wanted this to be executed in spite of the fact that the Phaeton&#39;s electronic specifications wouldn&#39;t allow it to go beyond 250 km/hr.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A 24-hour top speed driving capacity.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">That the car should be able to tolerate an exterior temperatures of up to 50 degree Celsius at top speed and full capacity.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">That the interior temperature capacity be 22 degree Celsius.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">It ought to possess a torque of 37000nm/degree.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Phaeton concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Image-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from these, the following characteristics of the Volkswagen Phaeton clearly come across as an advantage -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A 335hp engine</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">An axle ratio which is very short</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A wheelbase that is about 3000 m long</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A four-zone climate system</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A quadra-motion 4-wheel drive</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Air Suspension that adapts accordingly</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Damping control that works continuously</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>A New Concept Altogether!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also the very first of its kind and has resulted in the signing of quite a few individual patents. While the build and the capacity of the car is great, its sales haven&#39;t been as good. Though, it is selling very well in a few Asian countries, its sales in North America have been relatively far too low. The production of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Phaeton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Phaeton</a> was completely halted in 2006. After which, the model went through a few modifications and facelifts, but things haven&#39;t yet worked out for this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">One of the reasons could be that the engines that were being sold in the American market had a few limitations. At the same time, the car came with an extremely advanced technology which made the drive the smoothest and the most convenient for the consumer.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Technologies that it has to Offer!</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"a car of the best quality\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Image-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The following technologies are available in a Phaeton -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A 5.7 Electronic Stability</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">ABS i.e Anti-lock brake</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Electronic Brakeforce Distribution</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A four-zone climate system</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">ASR and Traction Control</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">EDL (Electronic Differential Lock)</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If one is looking to <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">buy a second hand luxury car</a>, then this is known to be the best bet. It is not only a car of the best quality but also runs on one-of-a-kind engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, one of the major drawbacks of the Phaeton is its unconvincing body. With a body like that one and the kind of weight implications it comes with, it is hard to break into the premium brand market of luxury cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">While it has an adaptable air suspension, it works best at mid-position. It&#39;s got a good grip thanks to its weight. However, the added weight can often act as a negative point. Yet, it can be countered with too many positives, the best one being the 230bhp engine.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since it is competing with premium luxury cars, it has to offer comfort. Well, it does! The following features come-off starkly when it comes to interior seating comfort -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Eminent Seating</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Climate Control</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Noise Isolation</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spin your Ride!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Phaeton also provides for an extremely smooth ride. Thanks to its distinct design, there is more than enough room inside the car, thus making it a great ride for both, the passengers and the drivers. Apart from that, it has a boot that is as huge as 500 litres. So, it gives enough space for luggage as well as passengers. With 120mm of adjustable extra space, it is a solid deal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, one thing is very clear. This is a car solely for someone who is extremely rich. It isn&#39;t going to make things better for you financially. Here&#39;s how you are going to lose cash like crazy on this one -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Very low resale value</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Very High Cost Price</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Very High Taxes</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Very bad Economy of Fuel</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">High Cost of Service and Maintenance</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, unless you have money raining on you, this car is not for you. Otherwise, the competitors might honestly stand a better chance than the Phaeton.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Every Coin has Two Sides! Sometimes, You Win Both Ways!</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the antique finishing of the car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Image-4.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly though, the car hasn&#39;t been in production since 2014 and an all-new electronic version is to be launched this year. Also, the car has had mixed reviews since its inception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Yet, it caters perfectly to the luxury market and is an excellent marvel. It is also pleasing to drive around in a Phaeton. Yet, some people are of the point of view that a backseat drive is much more comfortable and fun than having to chauffeur the car yourself.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, while the space is amazing at the back, the front seems to be a little cramped. Also, a lot of users aren&#39;t fans of the wooden and veneer finishing. However, some like the antique finishing of the car. One might conclude that it is a classic combination of antiquity and modernity with a wooden and veneer finishing on the body and digital gadgets for the sake of convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a lot of negativity surrounds the weight of the car, it&#39;s not really a compromise on the amount of comfort level the car offers. It offers ease of operations to the driver too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>Also, if you do want to go for a full throttle on this one, you are indeed in for an enjoyable ride.</strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>The wait is over &ndash; after Maserati unveiled the Kubang Concept in 2011, the company confirmed that it is working on the Maserati of SUVs and days before the official debut at Geneva Motor Show, the company took the wraps off from its highly awaited SUV. A look at the SUV and it is evident that tailoring the Maserati design language for the SUV silhouette was not an easy task &ndash; and even though it took five years, the designers did come up with an SUV that is unmistakable Maserati.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">The name <a href=\"https://www.maserati.com/maserati/en/en/index/models/levante/levante.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Levante</a> is taken from a Mediterranean wind and is chosen as a tribute to the sporty nature of the SUV &ndash; a blend of Italian passion, Maserati&rsquo;s engineering prowess and the exclusivity that comes with the brand heritage. Rest assured &ndash; this is an SUV built like any other Maserati and has perfect proportions and will have a soundtrack to match the performance, on road and off the road.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Design</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewed head on, the familiar <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/maserati\">Maserati</a> grill is imposing as ever and wears the Maserati trident with proud. There is a slim channel below the grill, which joins the air intakes that are placed low on both sides of the grill. The headlights are tapered and the top part of the headlight joins the grill and gives the face an aggressive air. The fog lights sit between the headlights and the air intakes. The bonnet has a prominent power bulge, which adds to the character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The side profile of the Levante has the traditional porthole shaped air intakes and the Maserati &lsquo;Saetta&rsquo; logo on the C pillar &ndash; the signature design stroke of any Maserati. The windows are frameless and the chrome accents give the car a richer look. The roof line tapers and mimics a coupe and the tapered rear is complimented by the rear fenders that bulge out to give more balance to the design. The rear spots wraparound tapered tail lights and an integrated roof mounted spoiler. Quad exhausts flank what appears to be an underbody protector. The lines are more curvaceous and suit the design language well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Under the hood</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the twin turbo 3.0-Liter V6 petrol and diesel engines \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Under-the-hood.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Levante features an advanced chassis that will offer an excellent balance between on-the-road and off-the-road performance and offers unparalleled handling and excellent grip on challenging surfaces on-the-road and off-the-road. All versions of the Levante will have electronic suspension with air springs and controlled damping with multiple adjustable modes. The Q4 intelligent all-wheel drive will be standard on <a href=\"https://www.maserati.com/maserati/international/en/models/levante.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">all Levante models</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there is no clear cut information for the horse&#39;s mouth about the engines to be used (other than the fact that Euro 6 compliant petrol and diesel engines will be available, coupled with specially calibrated 8-speed automatic transmission), it is safe to assume that the twin turbo 3.0-Liter V6 petrol and diesel engines (the petrol with two state of tunes and diesel with two or three different state of tunes) and the range topping V8 (borrowed from Quattroporte) will be available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color: red;\">The V6 petrol motor will churn out 345bhp and 445bhp in two tunes, while the diesel will be churning out power from 245bhp to 345bhp, depending on the tune. The range topping V8 will has 530bhp or thereabouts. All these engines will be mated to a specially calibrated 8-speed automatic gearbox.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Verdict Car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Verdict.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is hard not to sit up and take notice of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">burgeoning luxury SUV market</a> and all the luxury car manufactures worth their salt are trying their hands on getting a pie of the market. Of late, Bentley, Jaguar, Rolls Royce and Lamborghini have joined this bandwagon, though the move did ruffle few feathers of the traditional customers. While the entry from Maserati will not be viewed favorably by the competition, it will help Maserati attract new clientele and will help them retain the existing customers who are looking for the Luxury SUV experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Maserati is betting high on Levante and it is expecting the fifth offering from Maserati that will top the sales chart and will contribute a lot to reach the projected sales volumes for the year 2018.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Price</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">The Levante will not be cheap &ndash; after all, it is the Maserati SUV. The Ghibli is priced from $69,000, so it is fair to assume that the Levante will command a premium over this pricing and that pegs the starting price at around $75,000. The SUV that has been unveiled at the Geneva auto show in March 2016 will hit the showrooms by 2017.</em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

And then scratching your mind and wondering what if this car had this feature, or what if I could fly my car just to avoid traffic, or what if I could sail my car into the ocean?</p>\r\n<p>Usually, the automakers too come up with such unique ideas in their cars that mostly showcase the latest or futuristic style and the technology. And we all know them as Concept Cars. To be honest, very few such concept cars see the day of the light in the form of <a href=\"/collection\">luxury cars</a> as most of them get wrapped up as concept only. But then, one cannot deny the fact that the concept cars have more gravitational pull (don't take the word in literal terms) than the real ones. And why not, their style, design, technology, concept, everything is an exception and people do like such exceptions.</p>\r\n<p>If you've ever been to an Auto Expo or if you follow Auto Events, odds are the chances that you didn't notice any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">concept car</a>. They are so designed that you simply can't ignore them as they are the staples at the major auto shows and events. Futuristic vehicles that look exciting, have high-tech interiors and enormous shiny wheels become our dream vehicles with just one glance, keeping aside the fact that many of them would not be able to make their way to a genuine road auto.</p>\r\n<p>Let's have a look at few of the show stealer beauties that provide you a slight glimpse of the future:</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Concept Cars &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; A Vision into Future\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/infographic-concept-car.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: left; margin: 0 0 15px;\"><strong>Embed This Image On Your Site</strong> (copy code below):<br /><textarea readonly=\"readonly\" style=\"width: 98%; height: 80px; padding: 10px; background-color: #fff; border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; text-align: left; resize: none;\">\t\t&lt;strong&gt;Please include attribution to https://www.bigboytoyz.com with this graphic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href='https://https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/concept-cars-a-vision-into-future'&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.bigboytoyz.com/images/article/infographic-concept-car.jpg' alt='Concept Cars – A Vision into Future' width='800' height='6880' border='0' /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n</textarea></div>\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_300#300C\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">300C</a> was never sold in India, officially. But because it was such a famous car back then, (and still is, actually), you can find a few rare examples of some of the cars imported over here in the country. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\">Buying a used car</a> brings some apprehension, but if you find a good car with a clean history and faultless mechanicals, you should not hesitate to invest in the car of your dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">This is where BBT comes to your rescue; all the cars are checked for past records and carefully monitored and checked before selling it to the next client. Now, let&#39;s take a look at what all points one should keep in mind while buying a used Chrysler 300C in India.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chrysler 300C Variants</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Chrysler 300C Variants\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/02-jdpower.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.jdpower.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Chrysler 300C was made available in two body types- <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">Sedan</a> and Estate. The sedan is mostly preferred among luxury car buyers, and as a result, you will find that more easily as compared to the estate wagon. <a href=\"https://www.chrysler.com/en/300/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Chrysler 300</a> was produced between 2003 and 2010. 2005 onwards, the base 300 was renamed as LX while the more powerful and better-equipped versions were renamed as 300C. The Chrysler 300C was available in Touring (estate car for European markets), saloon and SRT-8 variants among others. In 2011, the second-gen Chrysler 300C was launched, which is still on sale in global markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chrysler 300C Engines</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Chrysler 300C Engines\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/03-only-carz.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://only-carz.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chrysler 300C was produced both with petrol and diesel engines. Since the car was first launched in American markets, there are more petrol engines to choose from. The petrol models of the Chrysler 300C can be had with 4 different engine options. The base model came powered by a 2.7-litre V6, although that is considered to be a bit underpowered for all the bulk it has to carry. The 3.5-litre V6 that was offered next to the 2.7-litre V6, offers decent performance and is reasonably fuel efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">For those obsessed with power and noise, the HEMI V8 motor is the one to have in the 300C. The V8 motor is available in two options &ndash; a 5.7-litre and a more powerful 6.1-litre (SRT-8). The latter develops 450bhp and 560Nm and is capable of hitting 0-100km/h in 4.9 seconds. The petrol models come mated to either a 4-speed or a 5-speed automatic transmission available in rear- or all-wheel drive configurations.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diesel-powered versions of the Chrysler 300C were only sold in European and Australian markets. The Chrysler 300C diesel came fitted with a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/e-class\">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> derived 3.0-litre V6 engine that has a rated power output of 215bhp @3800rpm and a peak torque of 510 N-m @1600rpm. The engine comes mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. For a diesel engine, performance is brisk too; the V6 diesel can propel the 300C from 0-100km/h in 7.9 seconds while the top speed is 230km/h.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\" buy a used Chrysler 300C in India\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/04-i.ytimg.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://i.ytimg.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/chrysler/300c\">buy a used Chrysler 300C</a> in India, try and get one that has run under 30,000 kilometers. Also, check it extensively for body damages and go through the history of the car including car crime checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diesel variants of the Chrysler 300C are more famous in India. Since these come powered by a Mercedes-derived V6 engine, reliability is not going to be an issue if you buy a car that has clocked less than 30,000kms on the odometer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">However, if you want a true-blue American muscle car in an elegant and quite unique body of a luxury sedan, try and go for the HEMI V8 equipped petrol versions. There&#39;s no doubt that it will drink more fuel on every outing in comparison to the diesel motor, but then, fuel economy should be least of your concerns!</em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

With saloon, estate and <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/coupe\">coupe</a> to complete the lineup, we expect new energy among the Mercedes fans. The new C-Class Cabriolet&#39;s soft-top will be available in the showroom from this summer onwards and expected to be in the price range starting from &pound;37,000 (it&#39;s Mercedes after all).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designed like other family members</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes C-Class Cabriolet\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/cabriolet2.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://wp.widewallpapers.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The C-Class Cabriolet has familiarity with the other models of the <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, especially with the S-Class Cabriolet, larger version of C-Class. Cabriolet&#39;s dimensions are identical to the C-Class Coupe i.e. 4.6cm long by 1.8m wide. It also shares a lot of features with the model like similar robust grille, impressive LED headlights, beautiful curved boot and tail lamp, designs are quite similar and they are available in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\">convertible version</a> as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cabriolet is an amazing creation of the Mercedes, which comes in two versions of the roof:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A basic version (well, every car has it)</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">A soundproof version (WOW! That sounds like a VIP thing)</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The soundproof version of the roof is an expensive deal and is available in attractive colors like brown, blue, red, and black. So, whenever you feel like flaunting your newbie convertible Cabriolet in the town, just push the button and it will open the sky for you in less than 20 seconds at a whopping speed of up to 31mph. Don&#39;t you feel like owning this beauty right away?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What makes Mercedes C-Class Cabriolet so Powerful?</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes C-Class Cabriolet so Powerful\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/cabriolet3.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://cdn.editorial.autoweb.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The Cabriolet has a wide range of engines; you can choose from six petrol and two diesel models. All the models offer nine-speed automatic gearbox and there are couple of models that are available with Mercedes&#39; world-known powerful 4MATIC four-wheel-drive-system. All the models promise a smooth and thrilling driving experience to its drivers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>C-Class Cabriolet is Tastefully Designed</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cabriolet is laced with some wow elements that would definitely make you fall in love at the very first sight. Apart from its gorgeous heat-reflecting leather upholstery and spacious rear seats that split 50:50 to provide you with extra boot space, C-Class Cabriolet has got Mercedes&#39; advanced technology Airscarf and Aircap systems. These are the hi-tech systems that take the turbulence out of driving with the top down. This technology together works best in cooler weather when convertible cars are either packed in the garage or their rooftops hardly get a day off. When the temperature is dipping and you still wish to feel that breeze on your face, use Airscarf and Aircap. Aircap helps in keeping the cold air out of the cabin; while on the other hand, Airscarf provides a soothing heating system at the most ignored neck area. Together, both the features make sure that you enjoy a long drive in your convertible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Muscular look, Stylish feel</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Muscular look\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/cabriolet4.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://blog.mercedes-benzsouthwest.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Taking key points from the new S-Class Cabriolet, the C-Class Cabriolet speaks &quot;sensuality&quot; language from every pore of its body. On the other hand, it does retain its sporty feel and show a muscular look. Its exterior design along with 18-inch alloy wheels and comfortable driving seat gives you a sporty feel.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Diamond Radiator Grille along with the standard LED headlights gives a suave feel to the complete look and feel. Cabriolet has a sassy chrome trim and its 0.6 inches lower, giving the model a sportier appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Safety &amp; Convenience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Mercedes has added comprehensive safety system, which makes this model more competent and appealing. The car provides a huge airbag system, including front airbags, knee bags, pelvis bags and window bags (you are absolutely safe in this car).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is loaded with oodles of safety features, which promise to keep you safe while driving. For instance, the Driving Assistance Package comes with adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection and lane assist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/vehicles/passenger-cars/c-class/the-new-mercedes-benz-c-class-cabriolet/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mercedes C-Class Cabriolet</a> is attractive, suave, sporty, powerful and safe; all these features make it model a definite winner.

  "postcontent": "<p>Often you are close enough to purchasing a luxury car but not yet there. This is when you go ahead and buy a Phaeton. It is one of the best luxury cars in the market and isn&#39;t priced exorbitantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">However, if you like your car to growl at full throttle, this is definitely not for you. Yet, if you like to zoom by quietly, this is your ride! If speed is your best companion, this is the vehicle for you. Its speed increases in no time and has a pick-up of around 5-6 seconds approximately. A supercar at budgeted price, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Phaeton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Volkswagen Phaeton</a> is the car that shares its platform with <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley\">Bentley</a> Continental GT and Flying Spur.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, its system and the engine are well coordinated to give you an extremely comfortable and luxurious feel. While the car is technologically advanced, it is user friendly too. It doesn&#39;t really complicate matters as such. Yes, it makes some noises but all those noises are feeble and inaudible, not so hard to deal with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">So, to sum it up, your ride is going to have no bumps and no noise. Now, moving on to the comfort level in the interior of the car, which is very high. The dampeners keep the temperature regulated and you don&#39;t have to keep using and re-using them. While the car is extremely heavy, it doesn&#39;t really let you feel the weight on the drive.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Paradigm Shift of Pressure</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Car-interiors-with-clock\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/PhaetonInterior.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://www.mad4wheels.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>You might not feel the weight but you do feel the pressure to keep an eye on the performance. It is slightly complicated for the driver and a shade uncomfortable as well. Thus, you will need some time to get used to it. The system while being easy and comfortable, is kind of new and hence, one will have to work his/her way around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Yes, the car is technologically advanced but maybe it&#39;s a bit too advanced. It gives way too many notifications, once that you might not even want. Now, it is hard to concentrate on the ride when you are being notified even by the minutest details about what&#39;s going on with your car.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, one can&#39;t deny that there is no better backseat ride than on Phaeton. It gives you the ultimate experience of a backseat ride. It is amazing. The dream businessman that you see on TV can be achieved on the backseat of a Phaeton. To add to it, it is extremely spacious.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Luxury in your Pockets!</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\" a Mercedes-Benz E-Class\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Phaetononroad.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://roa.h-cdn.co/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusively, the Phaeton does come across as a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">luxury car</a> that costs far too less than its competitors. In fact, it works better than a whole bunch of them, though one may never be fully satisfied with the feel of the car, until its technological specifications are revealed. Here&#39;s to the stat obsessed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">So, the car is huge on tax and its first look is like that of any other car until you actually take it for a spin. Yes, it&#39;s a sedan. It has a 48 valve, 4-motion W-12 engine which is why the car functions as smoothly as it does. Yet, it is worth mentioning that the 12V is actually a combination of two 6Vs. With over 400bhp and a 366cu displacement in spite of its size, this beast has it going for itself.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diesel-powered versions of the Chrysler 300C were only sold in European and Australian markets. The Chrysler 300C diesel came fitted with a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/e-class\">Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> derived 3.0-litre V6 engine that has a rated power output of 215bhp @3800rpm and a peak torque of 510 N-m @1600rpm. The engine comes mated to a 5-speed automatic transmission. For a diesel engine, performance is brisk too; the V6 diesel can propel the 300C from 0-100km/h in 7.9 seconds while the top speed is 230km/h.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It Fits Well But Will it Sit Well?</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"budget luxury sedan\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Phaetonexterior.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is an automatic with 5 gears. Its fuel economy isn&#39;t really excellent, yet, if you wish to drive an in-budget luxury sedan, there are places where you must be willing to compromise. Nonetheless, other than a few extra expenses on the fuel, it is an amazing car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Phaeton suits both short as well as long rides once you have found your level of ease in it. Its name has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaethon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Greek mythology backdrop</a> to it which adds to its charm and fascination. When it comes to design and structure, one may not say that Phaeton is the &#39;best&#39; but it definitely deserves a &#39;better&#39; tag. If you want that much space on the inside, then there isn&#39;t much else that you can do with it. Sadly though, the masses haven&#39;t taken fancy to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>A major reason being that Volkswagen Phaeton is neither completely vintage in its looks nor is it fully modern. Somehow it looks out of place and can&#39;t be classified as a head turner. Yet, if one is willing to ignore the looks, the vehicle has a lot going for it. Maybe, we look a little closer?</strong></em></p>\r\n",

So I told them, &quot;Do you see a Ferrari with bumper stickers?&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is rightly said that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder but Italian beauties have always attracted attention of even those who are not car fanatics. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> doesn&#39;t need any introduction, as the children also know what Ferrari is and what it stands for. Well for those who believe that ignorance is the bliss, Ferrari stands for perfection, sportiness, technology and elegance. Each of its products reflects poshness and sophistication and when it cruise the road, other cars bow their heads in respect to celebrate its arrival and speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered to be the world&#39;s most powerful brand producing <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sports cars</a>, Ferrari is mostly involved in motorsports, the most popular among which is Formula One. The prancing horse in the badge is self-explanatory when it comes to the horsepower of the Ferrari&#39;s cars and what more needs to be said as the marque has expanded its root in nearly 60 markets worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brand enjoys a huge esteem in the automobile market and the live example to prove the same is the Ferrari World that is the <a href=\"https://ferrariworldabudhabi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">first Ferrari theme park of the world</a>. And it will be interesting to know that because of the World War II; the launch of the first Ferrari got delayed, which later was released in the year 1947.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the first Ferrari theme park of the world.\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/ferrari-world.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://img.carnews.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be shocked to know that the classic red color of Ferrari cars, which made them so popular among the crowd, was not the choice of the company but the FIA (International Automobile Federation) assigned that color to all the Italian racing cars at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Prix</a>. As of today, the bright red color represents around 45% of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari cars</a></strong>. The official figures state that more than 5000 sanctioned races have been won by the drivers of Ferrari.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also a less known fact about Ferrari is that in 1969, Enzo Ferrari sold off nearly 50% of the shares of his company to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) for the much needed capital. Later, the Ferraris sold more share and retained only 10% of the ownership. Today, all the Ferrari beauties come with customization option so as to give the owner a personalized touch of WE CARE.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Car-interiors-with-clock\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/ferrari-race2.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://britishgt.files.wordpress.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferrari has the charm that it can turn its extreme rivals into friends and Maserati stands at the first place. The marque (Maserati) now uses Ferrari engine for its Fiat. In fact, the first bitter encounter (early 1960s) between Mr. Lamborghini (a tractor maker that time) and Mr. Enzo Ferrari became the major reason for the birth of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini cars</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><em>&ldquo;If you dream it, you can do it&rdquo;</em> &ndash; <b>Enzo Ferrari</b></span></p>\r\n",

In existence since 1989, Land Rover Discovery is a perfect combination of exceptional versatility, engineering integrity and design excellence. Without losing the grounds of the celebrated Land Rover capability along with flexible interior, the Discovery has covered a long voyage with success and has undoubtedly been declared as the unsaid off-road winner each time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">A perfect partner trained to master every terrain, Land Rover Discovery goes through rigorous quality and toughness test for more than 18 months in most torturous conditions.

There are myriad factors contributing to the ever increasing pollution in Delhi NCR. The recent implementation of odd-even scheme by the AAP government has been lauded as a bold step by most of the environmentalist across the country. It even pushed Arvind Kejriwal into the <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/kejriwal-finds-spot-on-fortune-s-list-of-50-greatest-leaders-pm-modi-conspicuous-by-his-absence-116032500328_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">coveted list of Fortune&#39;s list of &#39;50 greatest leaders&#39;</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Due to increased pollution many expats in the city are probably reconsidering their assignments and trying to avoid bringing their families in such unhealthy environment where it&#39;s dangerous for kids to roam around on cycles in the city. Embassies are reducing staff needed for their operations and even installing high end air purifiers in their offices.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attributing the increase in particulate matter levels in the air only to vehicles, especially the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">luxury diesel cars</a>, is not an accurate opinion. Having said that it doesn&#39;t absolve the increasing vehicular pollution from being a very big contributing factor in ruining air quality in Delhi. According to various studies the following are contributing to Delhi&#39;s air quality diminishing standards:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Road Dust</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Vehicular pollution</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Construction &amp; Industries</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Coal-based tandoors</em></li>\r\n\t<li><em class=\"dimText\">Concrete batching</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of just discussing how Delhi&#39;s becoming more polluted day by day, it&#39;s more important to understand the crisis and work on all fronts to make living in Delhi fun and healthy again. It will need to be a joint effort by the people of Delhi, various NGO&#39;s and the authorities to make sure that air quality improves in Delhi. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/green-signal-to-diesel-cars-in-national-capital-with-green-cess--reports\">Banning only the private diesel vehicles</a> or implementing odd-even scheme are not enough measures to curb the menacing pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>Emphasis on other contributing factors, such as road dust, construction sites, power plants, etc., too need to be put in order to fight against the odd.

The dream machines has left no stone unturned to drive the crowd crazy and the revving sound of the engine falls like a music on our ears. Well these machines may sound interesting to many but one can also not deny the fact that these beauties cost heavily on your pocket and only those born with silver spoon in their mouth can afford to buy the cars that amount in crores.</p>\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Like Evan Esar said, <strong>\"The car was invented as a convenient place to sit out traffic jams,\"</strong> as on today we can easily relate to the scenario considering the excessive traffic jams we face, especially in metro cities like Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai et al. So when you have to spend your nearly 4 hours daily in your vehicle then why not a supercar?</em></p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Car-interiors-with-clock\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Brand-new-Luxury-cars.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>India is a developing nation where the per capita income is not up to an extent wherein one can afford a supercar so buying a new Audi, <a href=\"/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, BMW or Porsche is not under the budget of many, so then how the demand for such premium vehicles has increased in the automobile market of India? The answer lies in the second-hand car market, which is more popular by the name of pre-loved or pre-owned luxury car market of India. With such recognition, soon the pre-loved car market will get 1.3 times bigger than the new car market.</p>\r\n<p>This is one of the high potential markets of a developing nation like India and ruling the roost is a Delhi based company &ndash; <a href=\"/\">Big Boy Toyz</a> &ndash; that deals in sale and purchase of pre-owned luxury cars throughout the nation.

  "postcontent": "<p>While there are many types of cars in the world which offers a multitude of driving rewards, there is nothing like the feeling of driving a cabriolet, on a warm sunny day, with breeze rustling your hair and fresh air enveloping you and taking you to a dream land. Often the convertibles are preferred by wide strata of customers since they offer versatility and practicality and a dash of panache when going topless.</p>\r\n<p>An added benefit of going the top down way is that, you get to enjoy the sonorous performance the engine is putting up &ndash; down under the hood &ndash; and in a marque like Maserati that is known for the musical symphony it&rsquo;s engines produce, this in itself is a compelling reason to sign the dotted line. The GranCabrio offers something irresistible &ndash; the drop dead gorgeous design which is hallmark of <a href=\"/blog/rendezvous-with-supercars\">Italian supercars</a>, tarmac scorching performance and handling, lavish interiors &ndash; a package which embodies all that is said about the Italian Flair.</p>\r\n<h2>Design</h2>\r\n<p><em><a href=\"/maserati\">The Maserati GrandCabrio</a> is essentially a drop top GranCabrio, and that is telling a lot in a very short sentence. The car has the same hunkered down stance, the curves which are at right places, the accents and embellishments that add the character and manage to look fabulous irrespective of the fact that the top is up or down.</em></p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Maserati-GranCabrio-Design\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Maserati-GranCabrio-design-28july.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.mendaily.com/maserati-grancabrio-mc-review-and-specs/</span></div>\r\n<p>The front fascia is familiar &ndash; the center stage is taken by the iconic oval grill with the trident at the center, flanked by aggressive air intake scoops and decorated by the sculptured headlights. The fender spots the porthole like air intakes, the beltline is taught and muscular and the overall style is more of a coupe, when the top is up. This is achieved by the forward sloping design of the soft-top roof.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.maserati.com/maserati/international/en/brand/company.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Maserati</a> believes that a convertible needs the soft-top made of cloth, and have taken extra pains to give a perfect soft-top made of top-notch cloth material. Usually the convertible counterparts of coupes are heavier since the convertible material and the mechanism add lot of weight, but it is remarkable that in GranCabrio, the soft-top and its operating system do not lead to any significant weight gain.</p>\r\n<p><em>The GranCabrio features a remote roof retracting option and by pressing a button on the key fob, you can retract the roof from afar. The top can be operated when the car is in motion, up to a speed of 20mph and it takes only 28 seconds to finish the retract.</em></p>\r\n<p>When the top is down, the coupe-like silhouette is transformed into a graceful and lithe convertible body line, which is accented by the short front and rear overhang and long bonnet with the powerful V bulge and the character lines that are finished in wind tunnel to reduce the turbulence when the car goes top down. The LED tail lights have 96 individual elements and the integrated rear diffuser adds to the character of the car, when viewed from rear.</p>\r\n<p><em><u>The 20-inch rims with spokes resembling the Maserati Trident, the chrome embellishments on the side (noticeably around the side air intakes and door handles) and the third break light at the rear &ndash; all these add to the dynamic yet graceful design of the GranCabrio.</u></em></p>\r\n<p>Those who like the styling to be sportier can opt for the MC trim, which adds dollops of sporty character to an already sporty design. The appearance is aggressive in nature, and the full width black spoiler adds character to the front fascia while the tail gets more sporty design and bottom is designed to aid airflow under the car.</p>\r\n<h2>Interior</h2>\r\n<p>GranCabrio is a genuine <a href=\"/convertible\">four-seater convertible</a> and can seat four adults in comfort. The interior is roomy and offers more room than the peers. As with any other Maserati, the interior is hand-stitched and finished with exquisite detail. There are acres of high quality wood and leather and the atmosphere is of a sporty elegance.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Car-interiors-with-clock\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Maserati-GranCabrio-interior-design-28july.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:http:https://www.topspeed.com/cars/maserati/2015-maserati-granturismo-mc-centennial-edition-coupe-and-convertible-ar163191/picture549499.html</span></div>\r\n<p><em><b>The dashboard features the familiar V-shaped strip and houses the touchscreen that controls the multimedia and navigation, among other things. The multi-function steering wheel houses controls for multimedia, telephony and speed and the dashboard layout is driver centric &ndash; all the control buttons are laid out for easy access by the driver. </b></em></p>\r\n<p>The car features an intelligent climate control system that recognizes if the top is up or down and adjusts automatically the air circulation and temperature settings. The soft-top, with three layers of material, offers excellent sound proofing when the top is down. It is noticeable that the usual turbulences associated with convertibles are next to absent in the GranCabrio.</p>\r\n<h2>Engine and Handling</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Maserati-GranCabrio-Engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Maserati-GranCabrio-engine-28july.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:http:https://www.caradvice.com.au/155538/2012-maserati-grancabrio-sport-on-sale-in-australia/photos/</span></div>\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The standard GranCabrio features a 4.6-liter 90 degree V8, which churns out 450bhp of power and 510Nm torque while on the other hand, the top of the line MC editions churns out a maximum power of 460bhp along with 520Nm torque. The engine is mated to the ZF sourced 6-speed automatic gearbox with hydraulic torque converter and multiple operating modes. The engine is designed with an eye to reduce friction and features innovations such as Diamond Like Coating (DLC) on tappets and camshaft lobes.</em></p>\r\n<p>The GranCabrio features computer controlled &lsquo;Sport SkyHook&rsquo; suspension with aluminum dampers which aids the handling and gives the car sporty credentials. The brakes are specially developed by Brembo and feature the dual cast technology that offers better performance and weight savings.</p>\r\n<p>In spite of being a convertible, the car gains only 100kgs of weight and gains a torsion wall which helps the stiffness and handling. The Maserati Stability Program (MSP) makes sure that the car remains stable under spirited driving and challenging conditions. When the sport mode is enabled, the MSP is evoked and the trigger threshold is moved upwards and the system works more on breaks and conserver the engine power so that the power is available for driving.</p>\r\n<p><em><b>The MSP ensures that the GranCabrio drives like no other car in the segment &ndash; the driving pleasure and control can rival even some hardcore sports cars.</b></em></p>",

It first made its public appearance at the Chicago Auto Show in 1989 and since then MX-5 Miata is ruling or better to say, dominating the supercar market internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">In simple terms, <a href=\"https://www.mazdausa.com/vehicles/mx-5-miata\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mazda MX-5 Miata</a> is the amalgamation of glass and steel that gets converted into adrenaline and emotion. The front-mounted SKYACTIV-G 2.0-litre V8 engine that comes with rear-wheel drive, 16 valves and 4 cylinders is capable of churning out a whopping power of 525PS @6000rpm and a peak torque of 663Nm @4600rpm.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"engine-of-Miata-MX-5\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/engine-of-Miata-MX-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://st.motortrend.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The same engine powers the Chevrolet Corvette whereas the major changes done in the MX-5 Miata include a new 6-speed manual Tremec T56 transmission gearbox and Chevrolet Camaro SS&#39;s rear differential. The suspension and the brakes too have been upgraded in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\" >convertible</a> along with other improved important mechanical changes that support the enhanced power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Though the new Mazda MX-5 Miata has seen a lot of improvisation and add-ons, the supercar has gained a reasonable weight of 119 kilograms. Do not forget that the car is tamed to deliver 370PS of additional power to balance with the increased weight, so the weight can be easily valuated. In fact, the weight distribution, for which Miata is quite popular, remains relatively unaffected at 53.4:46.6 (against 52:48 stock).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as the design is concerned, the award speaks it all! Yes, Mazda MX-5 Miata has been awarded with the 2016 World Car of the Year Award by the World Car Awards in the month of March. This is the result of the hard work and dedication with which its last four generations have been working to give the world an authentic and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">lightweight supercar</a>. What makes this roadster the protagonist among the car enthusiasts is its open-air driving style that make you experience something new every time you get behind the wheel. This is the reason, why MX-5 is the best-selling convertible of its time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bugatti-Veyron\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bugatti-Veyron.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.automobilebox.com</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em class=\"dimText\">The Japanese carmaker has also improvised the 6-speed manual transmission gearbox that is now lighter and smaller than its predecessors without compromising on the front of precision and performance. Adding more to the performance of this roadster is the rigid yet lightweight SKYACTIV-Chassis that also provide stability and nimbleness to the vehicle. The MX-5 Miata is already making a spur in the market and is topping the ladder in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/the-mafias-amongst-hypercars\" >popular sports car chart</a> in India. Though not official, the price of this roadster in India will be somewhere around Rs. 33.36 lakh.</em></strong></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Putting an end to the never-ending wait, Jeep India will be launching its <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUVs in India</a></strong> on the 1st of September 2016. Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Grand Cherokee will be the two models that will hit the Indian market for a price tag of Rs. 40-45 lakh and Rs. 35-40 lakh, respectively, though nothing official has been confirmed by the company. As of now, the company will import the two SUVs through CBU (completely built units) route. Both the off-roaders make their first official debut in <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/auto-expo-a-look-at-the-showstoppers\">India during the 2016 Auto Expo</a> held in Delhi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will retail the new models through 5 exclusive dealerships in India and slowly will aim to increase the number to 20-25 to make the network stronger. The American carmaker is planning to make India a global hub for its off-roading brand, Jeep. To achieve the set goals, the company has also planned to invest around Rs. 1500 to 2000 crores to improve the manufacturing unit in India alongside setting new manufacturing plant in India for SUV by Jeep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Also <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/fiat\">Fiat</a> has shaken hands with Tata Motors to help the production of Jeep vehicles in the country. The plant at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra is the 4th facility outside the US where Jeep vehicles are produced in bulk.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jeep-Wrangler\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Jeep-Wrangler.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://urcar.xyz/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the two Jeep models stepping their feet in the Indian soil, Wrangler Unlimited will be a <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/suv\">4-door SUV</a> that will draw energy from a 2.8-liter, turbocharged CRD diesel engine that has 4 cylinders and will be able to churn out a maximum power of 197hp @3600rpm along with a peak torque of 460Nm @1600-2000rpm. The engine will be mated to a 5-speed automatic tranny that will send power to the Command-Trac shift-on-fly 4-wheel drive system. The fuel economy of the engine will be 12.2kmpl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/car-news/2018-jeep-wrangler-to-come-with-hurricane-turbo-4-engine\">2018 Jeep Wrangler is rumored to come with Hurricane</a> Turbo-4 2.0-liter powertrain that is expected to churn out a maximum power of 300hp. The reports have further hinted towards a huge investment of $75 million for the manufacturing of Hurricane engine. Though considering the strict CO2 and PM emission norms in Delhi and other parts of the country, the company might shift to a hybrid engine for next-gen Jeep Wrangler. The production of new Jeep vehicle in India is slated to start in India in the second quarter of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jeep-Grand-Cherokee\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Jeep-Grand-Cherokee.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source: https://pictures.topspeed.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the second model from Jeep, for whom car enthusiasts are waiting with bated breaths, will hit the Indian shores in two variants, christened as Summit and Limited. And adding moreto the happiness of car aficionados, the top-end SRT variant of the Jeep Grand Cherokee has also been listed on the <a href=\"https://www.jeep-india.com/grand-cherokee-srt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">official website of India</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">This SUV will come with a 3.0-litre EcoDiesel turbocharged V6 motor that is expected to deliver a top power of 243hp and a peak torque of 570Nm. The engine will be synced with an 8-speed automatic transmission that has paddle shifters. The motor will shift power to its Quadra-Drive II in Summit model, whereas in the Limited variant the power will be send to all-wheel drive system or Quadra-Trac II. The fuel efficiency is expected to be 12.8kmpl.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high-performance variant of Grand Cherokee, the SRT, will be available with a 6.4-litre HEMI V8 engine that is supposed to throw a maximum power of 477hp and will be mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox with paddle shifters. When launched, the Cherokee will compete against the likes of Honda CRV and <a href=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/toyota\">Toyota</a> Fortuner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>Both the Jeep models will come with a standard set of features that include heated front and rear seats, 8-way power seats with memory, radio, mirror, auto-dimming rearview mirror with microphone and memory driver seat along with heated steering. In terms of safety, the SUVs will come supported with cruise control, rain brake support, airbags for driver and passengers, 4-wheel traction control, ABS, hill control, keyless entry and hill assist. </strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all overheard people saying that it doesn&rsquo;t matter to them which car they drive so long as it just makes them reach their destination. Well, those guys are all liars. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to be the owner of a classic car, one that makes people stop, and stare at you in envy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">As any curious car enthusiast, your mind must have wondered &ldquo;What makes a car, well, a classic?&rdquo; While it may be easy to define <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/enticing-old-beauties-at-the-50th-vintage-car-rally-2016\">Veteran and Vintage cars</a> by the number of years, it has always been ambiguous as to when a car starts to be called a &quot;classic&rdquo;?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it the exclusivity, the performance or the exotic looks? Even the most gorgeous car on the road might not be called a classic piece. So, how do you separate a classic from the rest? Like most things in life, there might not be one simple answer to this question. Definitions may vary between state agencies, insurance companies as well as between car owners themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em class=\"dimText\">So, let&rsquo;s dig a little deeper and try to find out, shall we?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A classic car could be any car you have seen around while growing up. It could be a car you wanted to buy when you were a kid or you still wish to buy in the future or a car you&rsquo;ve always dreamt about. This is of course, different from person to person and place to place.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The-Jaguar-XJ-S\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/The-Jaguar-XJ-S.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.modernhdwallpaper.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if we were to find what defines the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; element in any car, there would be a number of factors that would be involved. In an interview, Tony O&#39;KEeffe from <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/jaguar\">Jaguar</a> said that a car becomes a classic only when it has been out of production for a time more than 10 years at least. Interestingly, the definition fits well with Jaguar XK8 that gained this status only this year. Other cars such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XJS#1975\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jaguar XJ-S</a>, etc. are gradually starting to scale up in value to gain the status above being mere classic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">There are many people; however who do not agree with Kefee&rsquo;s definition that goes by the age of the car. They say that it is a wiser idea to determine its emotional value instead of the age of the vehicle. It becomes a classic when you remember it as a &ldquo;fun car that you&rsquo;d miss so much&rdquo; instead of just sticking by the years.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The-Ford-Mustang\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/The-Ford-Mustang.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://3.bp.blogspot.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Other things on the list would be &ldquo;Nostalgia, historical importance, looks and of course, performance&rdquo;. On the other hand, some may prefer car&rsquo;s scarcity over other factors, which would mean a low-volume car from a trustworthy and reputable manufacturer. But there are always exceptions. For example, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/ford-mustang-gt---the-story-unfolds\">The Ford Mustang</a> is one of highest selling car in the US, yet no one can deny its classic status. Why? Because this is the decision from the heart, and not by brain or money involved. It&rsquo;s indeed an emotional decision. Probably, that is why it becomes hard to find the exact science behind it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em class=\"dimText\">Once a car becomes a classic, there is a significant rise in its price, a rise that can be felt or noticed without much attention. There are many such cars, which include Porsche 944, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a> M3 or Jeep CJ-7s that are gradually but steadily appealing to the emotions of the people. So, the day is not far when these beauties would also get counted in the classics category. One thing about the classics that cannot be denied is that these are the cars that define performance, are cool and represent style that will never go out of fashion.</em></strong></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Unlike others, we would love to create the air of curiosity among the readers and hence we have decided to publish the 5th entry first, i.e., blog written by Guneet Bawa. Happy reading!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rightly said, <em><strong>&ldquo;True love doesn&rsquo;t have a happy ending always, because true love never ends.&rdquo;</strong></em> Though human life has an end, their love is eternal and immortal that stays in this lethal world forever. I am not talking about any fairy tale or a romantic dream but the real love story that is tragic yet inspiring. You might be wondering whether the protagonists finally met or not but let me clarify the story is very much different from a regular stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">I am talking about the legends who lived for cars and died for the same, leaving behind a remarkable journey to be embedded in the history in golden words. We all get mesmerized and delighted by the exotic beauties cruising the roads with a roaring sound, but the vigor and enthusiasm to drive these <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a> is alive in very few. You may call them superstars but for me they are the odd ones out among the mob of commoners.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ayrton Senna</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The seventh lap had just started and he gained a 0.6 seconds lead over Michael Schumacher and then something dreadful happened&hellip; something that sent the whole world into shock. No one could have ever wondered that this car race would have such a tragic end. The hero took his final journey into peace succumbing to his injuries. A Formula One World Championships winner, Senna will always be remembered for his <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/the-best-motor-races-around-the-world\">love for speed</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ayrton Senna\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Ayrton-Senna-in-car-race.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>James Dean</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hollywood&rsquo;s sex symbol and the heartthrob of many, was a car lover too. He used to call his silver<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_550\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Porsche 550 Spyder</a> the Little Bastard. Died at a very young age of 24 only, Dean was counted as one of the promising actors of the industry but the sudden demise brought all the hopes to an awful end. While travelling Route 466 his car collide with another car, killing him instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Paul Walker</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>If one day speed kills me, do not cry because I was smiling.</strong></em>&rdquo; These lines are enough to show the intense love affair between the two. Popular for his The Fast &amp; The Furious franchise, Paul William Walker IV bade his final goodbye to the world on the unfortunate day &ndash; 30th November 2013 &ndash; when his <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche\">Porsche</a> Carrera GT banged into the light pole, bringing his life to an end. But he will always be alive in the hearts of his fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Paul Walker\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Paul-Walker-in-Fast-and-Furious.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dale Earnhardt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another odd personality who sacrificed his life for the love of car and race and speed! Celebrated for his involvement in NASCAR stock car racing, the American race car driver succumbs to his head injuries during the final lap of the Daytona 500 at the Daytona International Speedway in 2001. His son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., took forward his legacy and continued his career as a racing driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>There are more such odd celebs who neither cared for money nor their lives but follow their passion.

Unlike others, this girl took that extra effort to find out the life history of a man who is now creating history everyday! Let&rsquo;s check out whom she is talking about:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;Schumi tries to push his way through and it&rsquo;s Tony outside the lane&hellip; and the last lap is about to begin&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly the alarm started ringing putting an end to the dream that has been chasing him for long. He wants to pursue his desire but can he? A big question that has been haunting him since the day he watched the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/the-best-racers-of-all-times\">Grand Prix at Buddha International Circuit live</a>. This is the last year of his schooling and he hasn&rsquo;t destined his goal yet. At an adolescent age of 17, he has the complete world at his disposal but something is troubling his mind. Should he follow the regular path of enrolling himself for a graduation course like his friends or is something else waiting for him at the far end?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Supercars-on-road\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Supercars-on-road.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://w-dog.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking his passion for a long voyage he finally advanced for what is predestined for him. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">Supercars</a> have invariably fascinated him so it&rsquo;s the right time to transform passion into profession. The market of pre-owned exotic luxury cars is still untapped and it&rsquo;s imperative to bridge the gap between these <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">premium beautie</a>s and their desperate lovers. He took the initiative to bring the supercars to the Indian shores through dealership at an economical cost because he firmly believed that there resides a superstar in every car lover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The journey was not easy but with his sheer dedication and smartness he was able to satiate his soul and passion. It took years to spread his glory but he never gave up and finally he succeeded in giving a firm shape to his dream that is now a reality. He was delighted to see the humongous response he received for his inventiveness from the car aficionados and now he is more determined to disseminate its reach throughout the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still a long journey to go but now he knows how to transform dream into reality!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.newswire.com/news/mr-jatin-ahuja-meet-the-man-behind-big-boy-toyz-7636148\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jatin Ahuja, the founder of Big Boy Toyz</a>, is now an inspiration for many budding entrepreneurs who wanted to come out of their world of illusion and live the grand life like a SUPERSTAR.</strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Seems like he is more interested in Bollywood stars and their life history and that&rsquo;s why he managed to dig out the information that is rarely known to many of us. Let&rsquo;s check out what he has to say:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all are mesmerized by the 4-wheeler beauties that run on the road and somewhere as a result of our hidden desire; we all have lived a dream of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">owning these supercars</a>, irrespective of the amount involved in the purchase. And then, back in our mind, we start envying the luck these superstars are born with, as they hold the possession of not one but many such luxury vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Well, not all are aware of the fact that many of these bigwigs, whom we consider our idols, had once in their lifetime bought second-hand cars during the struggling phase of their career. Let&rsquo;s check out few of the popular celebs who start the voyage of their success with pre-owned beauties:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Salman Khan</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Salman Khan BMW-i8\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/salman-khan-with-herald-car.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Our very own Prem who is loved and adored by many had driven a second hand <a href=\"https://www.heraldcars.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Herald</a> &ndash; a gift by his father, Mr. Saleem Khan, during the early phase of his career. The car was first used in the movie &lsquo;Zamana&rsquo; (1985) by veterinary actor, Rishi Kapoor, after which it was passed on to Salman Khan. According to Salman, the car was in a very bad shape but is still very close to his heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Amitabh Bachchan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">Don&rsquo;t widen your eyes as our beloved Big B, the owner of 11 luxurious cars, too falls in this list. Though the actor has very smartly carried the legacy of his poet father, Shri Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Amitabh witnessed a lot of struggle not only in the initial phase of his career but later too during his second innings. He purchased his first car, a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/fiat\">pre-owned Fiat</a>, in Kolkata when he got his first break as an actor in the cinema.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sachin Tendulkar</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Sachin Tendulkar BMW-i8\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/sachin-tendulkar-with-BMW-car.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;God of Cricket&rsquo;, who is always a delight to cricket lovers&rsquo; eyes, is also a hard core BMW fan and purchased his first love when he was only 20 &ndash; a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pre-loved BMW car</a>. The 43-turned cricketer has a garage full of spellbinding luxury vehicles, including the breathtakingly sexy &ndash; BMW i8 Plug-in Hybrid sportscar.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Shakti Kapoor</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular for his negative roles in Bollywood and proud father of the beautiful actress Shraddha Kapoor, got his first break in the movie Qurbani by an iconic actor/producer &ndash; Late Feroz Khan. It&rsquo;s his lady luck (not his wife but his used Fiat car) that gave him the opportunity for first break in Bollywood. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well here is the full story &ndash; One fortunate day, Shakti Kapoor was behind the wheel of his second hand Fiat when suddenly he bumped into another car, a new Mercedes-Benz, on Linking Road. To his surprise, the person inside the Mercedes was no one else but Firoz Khan. Doesn&rsquo;t it sound like a filmy story?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actor has admitted about his love for sports cars but he preferred buying second-hand cars only to save money at the initial stage of his career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Feeling jealous? Well you too can own one. Visit <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/our-showroom\">the Big Boy Toyz showroom</a>, the leading player in pre-owned luxury cars in India, and gift yourself an exotic beauty from premium brands like Audi, BMW, etc. and make your dream come true!</strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

It was his sheer determination and hard work that enabled him to conquer all odds, and earn a scholarship seat to his dream college that is also one of the prestigious colleges in India. He had burnt the night oil and studied under street lights. Being the son of a rickshaw puller, and with no access to expensive tuitions, he had beaten against all odds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">He painted his cycle, touched the feet of his parents and sets out for his college. His <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/are-you-born-for-a-ferrari--play-the-quiz-to-know\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">excitement was of a boy on tenth moon</a>. The wind blowing through his hair, and the scent of the flowers in the fields, he had never felt this before! This is the happiness that no money can buy!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He reached the college, hoping a superstar&rsquo;s welcome. However, as soon as he reached the college, the students looked at him and started to laugh. At first he could not understand the reason for being the butt of jokes. Then he looked at his rugged clothes and torn shoes. Rest of the boys and girls alike, wore colorful expensive clothes and were driving<a href=\"https://www.harley-davidson.com/en_IN/Motorcycles/motorcycles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> swanky bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/hatchback\">hatchbacks</a>. His chest that was swollen with pride fell flat. His excitement dived down and weaned of his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"boy sitting alone in college garden or canteen or library\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/boy-sitting-alone-in-college-garden-library.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://qz.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The next 4 years he put in his best efforts, studied diligently and emerged as a college topper, but he was looked at with disdain and pity by the students. Wearing crumpled and untidy clothes, he was no match for the branded clothes and watches that other students wore. He didn&rsquo;t make any friend in the college or it&rsquo;s fair to say that none of the student took interest in earning his friendship. Time passed on and subsequently in the final year, he found a decent job placement from his college.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><em class=\"dimText\">Time took its toll!</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few years, he received a letter from his college. It was a call for an old students&rsquo; reunion. His mind went nostalgic about an era gone by and ventured into the past gloomy days, but with a silent smile... The long voyage was not easy but he was insuppressible.&nbsp;The college required every student to wear formal business suits for the occasion with matching tie and shoes for the chosen day of Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The day arrived. He picked up his best possible clothing and touched the feet of his father, as always. His father, now old and fragile and having pulled a rickshaw his entire life, couldn&rsquo;t manage to provide legacy to his only son, but he (son) didn&rsquo;t need that anyway as the support and love of his father was enough to get him through that tough time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the venue, he saw his old colleagues. Women looked sexy and beautiful in long dresses and men looked handsome in fine black suits. The cars were bigger, better and the bikes indeed. Amidst all this, arrived a car or better to say a supercar that itself made its way through the busy lane of the college&rsquo;s car parking. The car was not ordinary, but a shining red metal jacketed Lamborghini, he purchased from Big Boy Toyz, with doors that pulled sideways.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Men in Black suit standing next to Lamborghini\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Man-in-Black-suit-standing-next-to-Lamborghini.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.lambocars.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Wearing a black tuxedo, it was him, who stepped out of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a>. A sudden silence dawned at the venue. The crowd was dumbstruck. He was none other than the CEO of the company that sponsored the reunion party of his college. It was yet again his sheer determination that made him reach where indeed few dared to dream!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>Much water had flown since.</strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

A tinge of orange had started to spread across the early summer skies when he woke up. Dressed in a silk night robe, hairs immaculate, he stretched himself off from bed. Almost nothing was in place in his otherwise clean apartment- shredded pieces of clothes everywhere; empty wine bottles clanking against spray-paint cans on the floor, and people. People, deep in slumber after the craziest of nights they had, occupying whatever little space they could gather for themselves on the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Etched right across the brilliantly red walls of his drawing room were the words, &ldquo;<em class=\"dimText\"><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/6-lexus-cars-ready-to-steal-your-hearts-in-2016\">Dreams DO come true</a></em>&rdquo;, in a rather amateur fashion. On any other day, he&rsquo;d have had nothing short of a heart attack at this sight. Not today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making his way through the sea of hung-over people, he reached for the newspaper. And unmistakably, it was his beaming face on the front page. &ldquo;Small town lad makes it big!&rdquo;, the bold headlines exclaimed. &ldquo;Close to $10 million for the Patna underdog in the first round of crowdfunding&hellip;&rdquo;, read the article. But there was just more to the smirk painted across his face, than just this success. Another dream was to be lived today.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Way-to-Gurgaon-by-road\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/way-gurgaon-by-road.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.google.co.in/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">He chose the best of suits from his wardrobe, his lucky trousers and began his search for a shirt. Red, it had to be red.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the garage downstairs, he gave one brief look to his Dad&rsquo;s old <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/volkswagen\">Volkswagen</a>. <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;Your final day buddy!&rdquo;</em>, he said, lightly tapping on the steering. And just like that, he set out for a voyage to the lands he loved. The roads to Big Boy Toyz, Gurgaon seemed livelier. The traffic failed to dampen his spirits today. He had forever dreamt of affording a place in this crowd, and now he had the money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">An appointment had been set the day before, for things had to be just perfect today. At the showroom, his sales advisor was already at the doors. A customary handshake was exchanged, but by now his excitement was far from being contained. The sheer sight of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a> set butterflies swarming inside this suave owner of a $10 million company. He was beaming with pride. This place of exclusivity was where he had seen so many superstars&hellip; Only today, he was one. He had made it big and life was awarding him today.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Red-Ferrari-from-Big-Boy-Toyz\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/red-ferrari-big-boy-toyz.jpg\" />\r\n<p>He eyed every mean machine parked inside- each representing a legacy of its own. He stopped in the middle. Covered with a red cloth, his car was parked right in the middle of all the drama. Delight engulfed him from all corners. They placed off the covers in the most dramatic way, handed him over the keys. He was an ecstatic kid now. Almost jumped inside the car and in the moment that followed- 597 horses neighed inside the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Naturally Aspirated V8</a>&hellip;</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End 404 Area --></div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Have you ever imagined what the life cycle of a car brand would be if nothing special is added up timely to spice up the show? The ongoing Mondial De L&rsquo;Automobile Paris 2016 has become the platform to witness the future. Puzzled? We are talking about the concept cars that made the motor show a grand success. Or it will be better to say that these concept cars are the lifeblood of these auto shows, which help in attracting a good number of crowd, among whom hidden are the prospective buyers in future. Concept cars provide an insight to the future and its advanced technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Many carmakers showcased their <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/top-exotic-cars-unveiled-at-the-2016-paris-motor-show\">soon to-be-launched vehicles</a> that attracted many viewers but this needs to be admitted that it was their concept cars that played the role of showstoppers at the show. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the few of the head turners that completely changed the concept of concept cars:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BMW X2</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"bmw-x2-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-x--concept.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://indianautosblog.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another compact crossover in talk that holds relevance to the global car market! Customers today are more inclined towards compact SUVs and crossovers and BMW X2 seems to have hit the right nerve. The SUV concept car from the house of BMW is designed give its German counterparts a head to head competition. It will enter into the production phase in the year 2018. The softening of the design language indicates the vehicle to be more organic and flowing and, of course, SEXY is the term to define its look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expanding its Sports Activity Coupe range, BMW is planning to bridge the gap between X1 and X3 SUVs. The large kidney grille coupled with big bumper in front and silver-colored lower trim makes the SUV look tougher and more rugged. However the appearance of the X2 concept seems be interesting and alluring, it is highly likely to be based on the UKL2 platform used in X1 and also may carry the cabin layout of X1.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Renault Trezor</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"renault--trezor\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/renault--trezor.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">This time, Renault made special arrangements for its guests at the Academy Des Beaux Arts by arranging supper for them along with a pair of glasses. So what&rsquo;s so different in it? Well, the glasses are not the normal one but the Oculus Virtual Reality goggles. And why? Because the French carmaker want them to have a look at the short virtual video of their concept car that marks the start of company&rsquo;s new design head, Laurens Van Den Acker.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With almost negligible chances of Trezor entering into the production phase, the low slung car with sporty appearance is simply a demo of what a budget carmaker can make, if it wants to. Bingo! So don&rsquo;t mess with it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When watched through VR Goggles, the Renault Trezor appears to be an unusual combination of pre-war MG and Star Wars Nubian Royal Starship. According to Van Dan Acker, <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;It&#39;s a statement of beauty, the sort of car I would put on the wall of my bedroom. A more responsible car we will do next year.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes-Benz Generation EQ</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"mercedes-benz-generation--eq\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/mercedes-benz-generation--eq.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.inautonews.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>When all other carmakers are showcasing their future vehicles at the Paris Motor Show 2016, why the age old German automaker, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, would stay behind? The company took the platform seriously and showcased 3 vehicles so far at the ongoing motor show among which 2 models are the concept cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes-Benz Generation EQ is an electric concept SUV that holds a stark similarity to the Volkswagen ID concept unveiled at the same show, in terms of design. The 400bhp SUV will come with a four-wheel drive system and will use an electric motor on each of its axle. The vehicle is expected to enter into production in 2019 and will compete against the Tesla Model X. The car is expected to run a distance of 300 miles with a single charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes-Maybach Vision 6</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"mercedes-maybach--6\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/mercedes-maybach--6.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now here comes the king! The looks, the appeal, the interior, the concept, the aggressive design and everything from front to rear seem to capture your senses through its mesmerizing spell. Well the more you speak about this beauty, the better are the chances of you falling in love with it. We too are in doubt, from where to start and where to end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The phantasmagoric car will make you go weak at the knees where the bonnet is longer than a normal bed and wheels stand tall, giving the lavish feel to the vehicle. The ultra stylish luxury car coupe is a homage to the aero coupes of that glorious age and is an effort to carry forward this legacy to future.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defining the beauty of the <a href=\"https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/design/ultimate-in-luxury-vision-mercedes-maybach-6/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Vision Maybach 6</a>, Gorden Wagener, head of Design at Diamler AG, states, <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;Our glamorous coup&eacute;, the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6, represents the ultimate in contemporary luxury. It is hot and cool.&rdquo; He further added, &ldquo;With its intelligent appeal and reduced, technoid look, it perfectly embodies our design philosophy of sensual purity and our pursuit of aerodynamic efficiency.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Volkswagen I.D.</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"volkswagen--id\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/volkswagen--id.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://hanabi.autoweek.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Volkswagen claims its ID electric concept car to be the first initiative in this direction, however, Tesla and Mercedes-Benz have already secured the same claim. Well, leaving the confusion aside, let&rsquo;s focus how Volkswagen ID can play the vital role in bringing a revolution in the automobile world. The four-seater ID will come with a 25kW electric motor and can hit the range of up to 371 miles with a single charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herbert Diess, chief executive of Volkswagen, said, <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;We want to challenge Tesla, Apple and the others in the electric vehicle market.&rdquo;</em> He further added that Volkswagen ID will be a true people&rsquo;s car where the augmented virtual reality will control the functionalities of the vehicle and there will be <em class=\"dimText\">&quot;no switches, no sticks, just screens.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lexus UX</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"lexus-ux\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lexus-ux.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The luxury car division of Toyota, Lexus too took the stage with its <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">compact SUV</a> for future. Christened as Lexus UX, the vehicle is based on the &ldquo;inside-out&rdquo; design concept and is designed by ED2, the Design Center of Lexus in South of France. It can be taken as the preview of company&rsquo;s future design philosophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alexandre Gommier, Interior Designer, ED2, commenting on the &ldquo;inside-out&rdquo; design concept, said, <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;The &#39;inside-out&#39; concept came from a lot of discussions within the team. We wanted to show the human-centric aspect of the concept in a visually as well as philosophically strong way. A strong symbiosis between the exterior and interior was felt to be important by all the designers involved. To create the anticipation from the exterior, which could then have a visual link and expand into the interior, was a key goal.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The motor show is ending on the 16th of October 2016 and we can expect more surprises from these automakers to take the world by storm. Stay tuned to get more updates!</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

And as we promised we are back again with some more amazing facts about cars that are still a mystery for many petrolheads. Passion for cars is not a new term in town as many examples are available from the glorious past of vehicles to prove what value these 4-wheelers hold in the life of a car enthusiast. The fascinating journey begins from 1769 when the world witnessed the first automobile powered by the steam engine. Taking the technology a step ahead, in 1807, the first car was designed by Francois Isaac de Rivaz, which was operated by an internal combustion motor powered by a fuel gas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, delving into the history of automobiles is captivating and a complete book can be written on how they came into existence and how technology can be evolved. But this is something we are not going to discuss over here. Let&rsquo;s not cudgel our brain and switch back to what will tickle your fancy for sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Energy Saver Brazil</strong> - You will be surprised to know that around 92% of the cars running on the Brazilian road are powered by ethanol that is produced from sugarcane. Hope we Indians too learn this unique way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Father is ALWAYS a Father</strong> - Suppose you are offered a Volkswagen Polo and a Lamborghini Aventador. Which one will you go for? Well, we know your answer will be Lambo, of course, and why not. Who would not prefer having a super luxurious car? But the fact is that Bentley, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\">Audi</a>, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti &amp; Ducati are the brands owned by Volkswagen itself. Shocked? We too are!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"bmw-x2-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Hitler-in-prison-writing-letter.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:#ff0000;\">A Letter from Dictator &ndash; Very few people know that when the world infamous Adolf Hitler was in prison, he wrote a letter to a Mercedes-Benz dealership in 1924. What&rsquo;s so interesting in this? Well he actually begged in that letter for a car loan for a limousine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More Deaths than Malaria</strong> - According to an international survey, the odds of dying in a car accident are 1 out of 5000 approximately. Another shocking fact is nearly up to 50 million people get injured in a car accident globally out of which 1.25 million lost their lives &ndash; a figure much higher than the deaths caused by malaria worldwide. So now you can easily figure out the population throughout the world!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wanna be One?</strong> - Do you know that an average customer who owns a Bugatti is also the owner of around 84 other cars, 3 jets and 1 yacht? Another revelation states that a Bentleys are for one percent of the elite class and a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley\">Bentley</a> customer generally has 8 cars. What will send chill down your spine is the fact that Bugattis belong to the only one percent of that one percent (Bentley&rsquo;s owners). May be this is the reason why only 450 Veyrons have been sold in a time span of 8 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"bmw-x2-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/First-car-accident-occurred-in-Ohio.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First Car Accident </strong>&ndash; The first car accident that ever occurred in the history of automobile is back in 1869 in the Ohio city. An Irish scientist, Mary Ward, was the person involved in the historic car accident, which unfortunately killed her instantly. Another noted accident that took place in the same city was of James William Lambert, who was an engineer by profession, according to the officials of Ohio. However, the first recorded car accident took place few years later in 1896 when Bridget Driscoll stepped off a London curb and got killed by an Anglo-French model car. Arthur Edsall was driving that car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Free Fuel</strong> - What if you get to know that an Asian country offers free petrol to its citizens? We are sure you would like to settle down their permanently seeing the rising price of fuel in our country. Well the country is Turkmenistan where the car drivers are allowed to enjoy 120 litres (30 gal.) of free petrol every month (don&rsquo;t read it year).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cars &gt; Population</strong> - This is true! The number of cars in the world is more than the people. Now just imagine if all the cars come on the road, what will happen? According to a report, there are 10 billion cars in the world against a population of nearly 7.2 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>World&#39;s Fastest Car</strong> - Hennessey Venom GT is the world&rsquo;s fastest street-legal production supercar. It can achieve a top speed of 434kmph (270mph). Earlier the car topping the chart was Bugatti Veyron Super Sport with a top speed of 431kmph (267mph).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"bmw-x2-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Henry-Ford-made-a-car-out-of-soyabeans.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Soybean Car</strong> - We are aware of the fact that cars are made of hard metals from the safety point of view but do you know that in 1941, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Ford</a> made a car out of soya beans? Recently known as hemp body car, the vehicle was built with agricultural plastic. The body of the car was partially made of soybean and hemp. This resulted in a vehicle that is lighter and more fuel efficient than a metal-bodied car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Highway Hypnosis</strong> - Does it ever happen to you that you don&rsquo;t recollect the direction <a href=\"http://insertarticles.com/\">of</a> your way to office/school? Your answer might be right! In that case, there are chances that you are suffering from a disease called Highway Hypnosis, wherein the driver has no recollection of his/her drive to work/school (autopilot).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Three-point Seatbelt Design</strong> - It was the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/volvo-unveiled-its-v90-cross-country;-india-launch-expected-in-2017\">Swedish carmaker, Volvo</a>, who invented the 3-point seatbelt design and the fun fact is that the company kept the patent open for other car manufacturers for free prioritizing the safety of the passengers. A survey says that it saves the life of 1 person every 6 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Car Crash Illusion</strong> - It is a fact that during a car crash nearly 40% of the drivers don&rsquo;t hit the brakes of the car. We know what you are thinking? That you don&rsquo;t belong to that 40% population! We too assume the same for us!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"bmw-x2-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/People-shouting-from-car-and-honking.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Honking is Illegal</strong> &ndash; No, we are not talking about any state or city of India, as honking has recently become a favorite pastime of Indians stuck in traffic jams. We Indians don&rsquo;t shy away from honking even when the traffic light is red. But it seems like in some parts of the world, there resides some sensible people who know how harmful honking is. In New York City, honking is illegal and you can be fined for blowing the horn of your car incessantly, unless it&rsquo;s an emergency. Also to note, most of the American cars&rsquo; horns beep at the sound of &ldquo;F&rdquo;, which stands for ____.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>No to RED</strong> &ndash; In a city of China there is a prohibition on red cars. Yes, you read it right! Owning a red car in this city is illegal. Though nothing official is available on the fact and some people are of the view that red color in China has association with good luck and fortune, hence this can&rsquo;t be true. Others state that changing the color of your car without informing the authorities is illegal in China and can fine you heavily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Biggest Fine Ever</strong> &ndash; The heaviest speeding fine ever imposed in the history of automobile is of $1,000,000. Yes, this hefty penalty was imposed on a guy driving at a speed of 18mph in Switzerland. It is said that the fine in the city is based on the speed and the salary of the driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Six Jesus Christ</strong> &ndash; No offend please! We are not harming the religious sentiments of any but sharing what weird has even happened. According to some report, in California, there are 6 driving licenses registered on the name of Jesus Christ and the biggest irony is that the government allowed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"bmw-x2-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Texting-while-driving.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Texting While Driving</strong> &ndash; We all know that it is very risky to text while you are driving a car and we might have assumed that it might doubles the chances of getting hit but the fact is that texting while driving increases the chances of a crash by 23 times. GASP!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slamming is Illegal</strong> &ndash; If you slam your car door, it might not bother your neighborhood or friends or family members, but if you are in Switzerland then you might have to mind your action as slamming your car&rsquo;s door there is illegal and can invite heavy fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Though there are more hidden car facts that are still trying to come into the notification of a petrolhead, they didn&rsquo;t draw our attention.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p><strong>Ferrari &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>A word capable enough to evoke dreams of splendor, adrenaline and a rush of blood to the head.</p>\r\n<p>All car enthusiasts wish to drive a Ferrari at least once in their lives, if not buying one. Bet you think of yourself as the biggest Ferrari fan and boast of knowing everything about it! Here are seven mind-blowing facts that will leave you spellbound:</p>\r\n<h2>1. Fiat Owned Ferrari</h2>\r\n<p>Yes, you read it right! For most part of the second half of the 20th century, Ferrari&rsquo;s majority stakeholder was Fiat! <em style=\"font-size: 25px;\"> Fiat bought 50% stake in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ferrari#1969_-_Fiat\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" style=\"color: #03c;\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari in 1969</a> and by the early 21st century owned a mind-boggling 90% stake in the company</em>. However in 2016, Ferrari got completely separated from FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) and become a fully independent business known as Ferrari N.V.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Ferrari Trades On NYSE with the ticker RACE</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"ferrari-trades\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ferrari-trades-on.png\" /></div>\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\" style=\"font-size: 25px;\">Typical of its origins, the Ferrari brand trades on the New York Stock Exchange (<a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:RACE\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" style=\"color: #03c;\" target=\"_blank\">NYSE</a>) with a ticker symbol RACE!</em> Racing is in their genes through and through. Not only that, Ferrari stock has a <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/RACE/market_cap\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" style=\"color: #03c;\" target=\"_blank\">market capitalization</a> of $12.53 billion as on November 4th, 2016. Style and monies to win it!</p>\r\n<h2>3. Ferrari Partnered with Alfa Romeo</h2>\r\n<p>Enzo Ferrari founded Scuderia <strong><a href=\"/ferrari\">Ferrari </a></strong>in 1929 with a sole wish to work on developing racing cars. Scuderia used to prepare, maintain and field cars for Alfa Romeo and eventually became the official <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ferrari#1929-1937_-_Scuderia_Ferrari\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" style=\"color: #03c;\" target=\"_blank\">racing department of Alfa Romeo</a> in 1933.</p>\r\n<h2>4. First Ferrari Came in 1947</h2>\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The first officially branded <a href=\"/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> came on the scene in 1947, same year as India&rsquo;s independence. This car was known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_125_S\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" style=\"color: #03c;\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari 125 S</a> and was powered by 1.5L V12 engine. Only 2 were made and even they were reportedly dismantled to produce the next Ferrari&rsquo;s cars.</em></p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"first-ferrari\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/first-ferrari.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.cleanmachinelongview.com/</span></div>\r\n<h2>5. Enzo Ferrari&rsquo;s Son is worth $1.2 billion</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Ferrari\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" style=\"color: #03c;\" target=\"_blank\">Piero Ferrari</a> is the only living heir of Enzo Ferrari&rsquo;s empire. He was born out of wedlock to Enzo&rsquo;s mistress Lina Lardi and <em><u>reportedly owns 10% stake in Ferrari which is worth over a billion dollars!</u></em> He serves as the vice chairman of Ferrari and still lives in his father&rsquo;s old mansion in Modena.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Ferrari is World&rsquo;s Most Powerful Brand</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"ferrari-is-most-powerful-Brand\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ferrari-is-most-powerful-Brand.png\" /></div>\r\n<p><em style=\"font-size: 25px;\">In a recent list by Brand Finance, Ferrari has topped the list as the<a href=\"https://auto.ferrari.com/en_EN/news-events/news/ferrari-the-worlds-most-powerful-brand/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" style=\"color: #03c;\" target=\"_blank\"> most powerful brand</a> in the world ahead of companies like Google and Coke</em>. In terms of revenue Ferrari lags behind when compared to other companies but in terms of brand loyalty, brand recall value etc. it apparently raced ahead to become the most powerful brand in the world.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Ford almost bought 50% stake in Ferrari</h2>\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong><a href=\"/ford\" style=\"color: #03c;\">Ford</a> almost bought 50% stake in Ferrari back in 1960&rsquo;s. As luck would have it, Enzo couldn&rsquo;t commit to the deal and that dropped deal led the fuming Ford to develop the legendary Ford GT40 that ended up winning four consecutive races.</strong></em></p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>For most of us, the word Tesla brings back memory of science textbooks, of the modern electric current system or of its founder Nikola Tesla who is accredited as the designer of the modern A/C electricity supply system. We can go on and on about Tesla, the scientist but this story is <a href=\"https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">about Tesla</a> Motors, the famed California automaker that has shaken down the very essence of cars as we know them and bought a new revolutionary approach to automotive industry and building a brand that everyone is crazy about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla cars are sick machines, let&rsquo;s be clear about that. And if you don&rsquo;t believe us then see for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla&rsquo;s design philosophy and technology is right there with the Ferraris and iPhones of the world. A Tesla car invokes curiosity and envy &amp; makes you wanna dump your petrol guzzling gasoline hungry machines. Under the hood a Tesla Model S is engineering exuberance with all wheel electric drive, 760 BHP electric motor which accelerates from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/hr) in a mere 2.8 seconds!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some crackling facts that will make you wonder when will you buy yourself a Tesla car:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Tesla Motor Was Not Started by Elon Musk</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us think of Elon Musk when we hear of Tesla motors. Despite him being the Force de majeure behind the company&rsquo;s meteoric rise and the main spokesperson, it was not him who actually <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.in/The-Making-Of-Tesla-Invention-Betrayal-And-The-Birth-Of-The-Roadster/articleshow/45114983.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">founded</a> Tesla Motors. Tesla motors was started by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Eberhard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Eberhard</a> and Marc Tarpenning. Elon Musk joined tesla as board member and then eventually progressed to be credited as one of the founders of the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Tesla&rsquo;s First Car Was A Sportscar Named Roadster</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla&rsquo;s first production model was Roadster, a spunky and sporty looking open top 2 door <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\">convertible</a>. It was officially revealed to public in an invite only event in 2006 in Santa Monica, California. Looks rad, ain&rsquo;t it?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Teslaâ€™s First Car Was A Sportscar Named Roadster\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/amazing-facts-tesla-motors.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Roadster_2.5_windmills_trimmed.jpg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Tesla&rsquo;s Model 3 Was The Most Successful Product Launch Ever</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla received a mind boggling 325,000 pre orders for its upcoming <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">sedan</a> Model 3. Fans of Tesla shelled out $1000 for a pre booking a product that will not be launched until 2018. Tesla earned around $325 million on the advance deposits alone making the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/7/11385146/tesla-model-3-preorders-375000-elon-musk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Model 3 product launch</a> the most successful ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Teslaâ€™s Model 3 Was The Most Successful Product Launch Ever\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/facts-about-tesla-motors.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Candy_Red_Tesla_Model_3_trimmed_2.jpg </span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Tesla&rsquo;s Market Cap Is $28 Billion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For a car company which prides itself on being a startup in the automotive sector, having a <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/market_cap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">market cap</a> of $28 billion is just awesome. We bet all founders of Tesla will agree. And just so you know, $28 billion equals to INR 1864938600000 as on Nov 9th 2016. Don&rsquo;t even try to figure out how many crores that will be! This much amount of worth can be attributed to only the most brilliant companies on the face of this planet and Tesla surely promises to be one.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Tesla Cars Need No Maintenance (Almost)!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For all motor car owners <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/auto-guide/how-to-do-proper-maintenance-of-your-lamborghini-\">maintenance</a> is the biggest headache. Tesla cars are designed to be <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/support/service-plans\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">light on maintenance</a> to make the ownership experience seamless and hassle free. On the Tesla Model S there are only six major parts which need regular maintenance or replacement and rest of the car practically needs no regular changes. These 6 parts consists of the 4 tyres and 2 wiper blades.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Tesla Cars Can Be Fixed Over The Internet</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s just insane to know that your car can be fixed by just updating it&rsquo;s software on the internet. With Internet of Things (IOT) increasingly invading our lives, a car fix over the internet was waiting to happen. And as usual Tesla has made this kind of thing a daily routine for themselves and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/02/teslas-air-fix-best-example-yet-internet-things/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recently fixed</a> a faulty charger plug on around 22k cars with a simple software update!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Elon Musk Is The Real Life Version of Tony Stark</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Elon Musk Is The Real Life Version of Tony Stark\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/elon-musk-fds.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8038/7956032050_5f611d98e2_b.jpg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Elon Musk is the biggest shareholder of Tesla Motors and is worth a cool <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$11 billion</a>. He is often compared to the marvel comic character Tony Stark aka Ironman and many think of him as the real life version of the famed comic character. Why is that one may ask? Mainly because he is a nerd who has heroic ideas for creating business and brands in fields where only few brave ones have dared to wonder. From finding companies as varied as an electric car company (Tesla), an aerospace manufacture (SpaceX) and a payment company (Paypal) to planning <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-crazy-is-elon-musk-s-mission-to-mars-1787146369\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">missions to Mars</a> and working on <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/hyperloop\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">superfast trains</a>. Elon Musk has plans for humanity and is doing things what a typical comic book hero usually does.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

There is just a certain satisfaction that comes when we see things breaking or blowing up - there just is.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s a good action movie if it does not involve blowing up of some cars, some crazy stunts eventually leading to even crazier car crashes? NOTHING!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we are on the subject, let&rsquo;s recall some of the most epic movies that have caused some serious damage to cars!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Transformers 3</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Transformers-3\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Transformers-3.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">https://media.gqindia.com/</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who hasn&#39;t seen <a href=\"http://www.transformersmovie.com/\">the all-time favorite Transformers 3</a>? If you&rsquo;re a fan of heartless action and violence, then we are sure you&rsquo;re a big fan. The action scenes in the movie are the best. In fact, the whole movie is more like a long action sequence. But did you know how many cars were destroyed during the shooting of the movie? Can you take a guess? In total, <strong>532 cars</strong> were destroyed. Shocked? So, were we. Although, it is believed that the cars used for these sequences were flood damaged cars donated to director <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Bay</a> and needed to be scrapped off by the law!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Matrix Reloaded</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Matrix-Reloaded\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Matrix-Reloaded.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes a movie really really (we actually mean it) good? Ever thought about that? Some good actors, a great director, a good story... Okay, how about violence, destruction and some well-timed murders and explosions? We know you want to say YES. During the making of Matrix Reloaded, it is said that over <strong>300 cars</strong> were ruthlessly destroyed, breaking the record set by The Junkman which destroyed about 103 cars during the filming. Outrageous, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Fast &amp; the Furious 5</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Fast-Furious-5\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Fast-Furious-5.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://cdn.collider.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the very beginning of the<a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/fast-and-the-furious-the-need-for-speed\"> Fast &amp; the Furious</a> Series, more than 1000 cars have been destroyed. Around <strong>260 cars</strong> were destroyed during the&nbsp;filming of <a href=\"http://fastandfurious.wikia.com/wiki/Fast_Five\">Fast &amp; the Furious 5</a>. A little unknown fact is that for making of Fast &amp; the Furious 6, they used around 400 cars (thankfully all of them were not destroyed!)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. The Junkman</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The-Junkman\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/The-Junkman.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://www.mustangimdb.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sequel to the epic <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187078/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gone in 60 seconds</a>, The Junkman is a movie for all the car freaks. The movie killed about <strong>150 cars</strong> in the process of its filming, setting a Guinness World Record for that time. Haven&rsquo;t seen the movie yet? Well, it&rsquo;s time you do.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<p>Remember when you were little and had posters of supercars on the walls of your bedroom? We all did that. But we never really bothered to find out the stories behind our <a href=\"/collection\">favorite supercars</a>, did we? Well, that&rsquo;s what we are here for.</p>\r\n<p>Lamborghini has always been a brand that has been loved by most. It is the name that will often come to mind when we talk about the world of supercars. Let&rsquo;s dig in find out things that you never really know about Lamborghini:</p>\r\n<h2>The first Lamborghini was a Tractor</h2>\r\n<p>If you are really into cars, you might be aware of the fact that the first Lamborghini was not a supercar, rather Lamborghini was involved in making tractors. As soon as World War II ended, Ferruccio Ferrari started manufacturing tractors from spare parts. It was only later that they entered the field of luxury cars. One thing that you might not know is that you can still <a href=\"/lamborghini\">buy a Lamborghini</a><a href=\"/used/lamborghini/2013-35-detail\"> </a>Tractor even today. They cost somewhere around $30,000 to $300,000.</p>\r\n<h2>Ferruccio Lamborghini &ndash; Real-life Tony Stark</h2>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Ferruccio Lamborghini &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Real-life Tony Stark\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Ferruccio-Lamborghini.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://cdn3.autobild.es/sites/default/files/imagecache/Car550px/</span></p>\r\n<p><em>During World War II, Ferruccio Lamborghini was stationed at Rhodes Island as the vehicle supervisor of Italian Royal Air Force. The job was tough as he had to find spare parts on an isolated island. Doesn't it remind you of how <a href=\"/collection\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Stark</a> built that nuclear reactor in the cave?</em></p>\r\n<h2>They&rsquo;ve got Ferrari to Thank</h2>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Ferrari car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Ferrari-car.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://www.techtricksworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Ferruccio was the owner of a Ferrari 250 GT. Not happy with its services he went to Enzo Ferrari for a part replacement. Enzo Ferrari did not take this request very positively and called him a &ldquo;silly truck driver&rdquo;. Ferruccio left in anger and four months later, Lamborghini&rsquo;s first supercar 350 GTV was out. True Story!</em></p>\r\n<h2>The first Lambo did not have an engine</h2>\r\n<p><img alt=\"First engineless Lamborghini\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/First-engineless-lamborghini.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://cdn.wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/</span></p>\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">When the first Lamborghini was unveiled, it was engineless. That&rsquo;s right. When 350 GTV was launched at Turin Auto Show it was without the engine as it was not finished yet. So, they just put in bricks and kept the hood shut.</em></p>\r\n<h2>The Astrological Angle</h2>\r\n<p><img alt=\"the Taurus sign\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/tauras-sign.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://www.123newyear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Have you ever wondered why Lamborghini has used a bull for its logo? Ferruccio Lamborghini was born under the Taurus sign and that is where the bull comes from. That also explains the names of Lamborghini models that are named after bulls- Miura, Gallardo, Diablo, Murcielago. Makes sense, doesn't it?</em></p>\r\n<p>As the famous saying goes &ndash; <strong><em>\"You <a href=\"/ferrari\">buy a Ferrari</a> when you want to be somebody. You buy a Lamborghini when you ARE somebody.\"</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Having said that, it&rsquo;s time to embellish your dreams! And those who already have one, kudos it&rsquo;s time to take a ride!</p>",

To some, it&rsquo;s the reality with a malign touch and to some, it may sound insulting but the fact of the matter is that the richest in the world are not a miracle. Recently <a href=\"http://www.forbesindia.com/\"><strong>Forbes</strong> </a>released its list &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The World&rsquo;s Billionaires 2016 Ranking</a> &ndash; and yes we can see major changes in the list, though the first position remains unchanged, like the past few years. Bill Gates surely has something in him!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike their profession, the common man has always found it enticing to take a bit of the personal life affairs of these riches. What if we let you know what cars this elite class drive or like to be chauffeured in? Well, hold your horses as the journey is going to take you to another world. Aahaan&hellip; don&rsquo;t fascinate supercars-like wagons for all, as you will be treated with surprise at every point. So let&rsquo;s start the voyage:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bill Gates (Net Worth &ndash; $75 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bill-Gates-with-his-Porsche\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bill-Gates-with-his-Porsche.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://hanabi.autoweek.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/\">The richest man on earth</a></strong></em> since ages, we guess, this American tech giant is a self-professed speed lover who seems to have some kind of fascination for a German car brand, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche\">Porsche</a>. Right from 1988 Porsche 959 Coupe that once was the world&rsquo;s fastest street-legal car to a tailor-made 1999 Porsche 911 Carrera (again the fastest car of its era) to Porsche 930 Turbo that Bill Gates purchased in the initial days of Microsoft, he seems to have the nicest collection of all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the cars, Bill Gates also owns a yacht and an island, The Grand Bugue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now something that only &lsquo;born with silver spoon&rsquo; richie can do!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Amancio Ortega (NW &ndash; $67 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Amancio-Ortega-with-Audi-A8\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Amancio-Ortega-with-Audi-A8.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://www.moibbk.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish business magnate, who is famous all over the fashion industry for his brand, ZARA. <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amancio_Ortega\">Amancio Ortega</a></strong> is the second richest businessman on earth. However, this year he successfully <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37317369\" rel=\"nofollow\">dethroned Bill Gates from his is numero-uno position</a>, but that happiness lasted for two days only. This 82 years old champ doesn&rsquo;t carry a fleet of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">luxury cars</a> to boast about his prosperity, even though he is very passionate about driving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amancio has always been a mysterious figure for the world, including the press but he couldn&rsquo;t hide his lady love &ndash; the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/a8\">Audi A8</a>. His only prized possession comes with loads of features, which include high-tech Quattro 4-wheel drive system along with user-friendly infotainment system. The futuristic look of the car makes it an exceptional beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Warren Buffet (NW &ndash; $60 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Warren-Buffet-with-Lincoln-Town-car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Warren-Buffet-with-Lincoln-Town-car.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://cdn.pinthiscars.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Berkshire Hathaway chairman defined his simplicity through the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">4-door luxury sedan</a> he liked to be chauffeured in &ndash; The Lincoln Town Car. Later he auctioned off his 6-passenger majestic chariot in the year 2007 for a charity purpose. Buying luxury cars in the name of royalty is not <strong><a href=\"https://www.biography.com/people/warren-buffett-9230729\">the Buffet&rsquo;s</a></strong> cup of tea and that is why you won&rsquo;t notice him being driven in <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/rolls-royce\">Rolls-Royces</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghinis</a></strong> or Ferraris. His next car was an 8-year old 2006 Cadillac DTS, which he replaced with the brand new Cadillac XTS in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He once quoted in Forbes, <em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;I only drive about 3,500 miles a year so I will buy a new car very infrequently.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Carlos Slim Helu (NW &ndash; $50 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Carlos-Slim-Helu-with-Navy-Mercedes\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Carlos-Slim-Helu-with-Navy-Mercedes.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The man behind Telmex &amp; America Movil, Carlos Slim Helu hasn&rsquo;t given up his thrust to vie with Bill Gates for the top rank in the richest competition but that doesn&rsquo;t entitle him to drive a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/rendezvous-with-supercars\">car that falls in the supercars category</a>. The third richest man in the world has a very simple choice, which of course is not simple for us. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley/flying-spur\">Bentley Continental Flying Spur</a>, priced around $300,000 (price more that the worth of houses in Mexico), along with Navy Mercedes-Benz 4x4 are the two beauties that find their place in the fleet of other cars in the huge garage of Carlos.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jeff Bezos (NW &ndash; $45.2 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jeff-Bezos-with-1988Chevrolet-Blazer\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Jeff-Bezos-with-1988Chevrolet-Blazer.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://upload.wikimedia.org/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Capricorn by birth, <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos\">Jeff Bezos</a></strong> started something that gives online shopping a completely new height &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\">Amazon.com</a>. The American business magnate believes in simple living high thinking and this is the reason why the 5th richest man on the globe still drives the 1996 Honda Accord, the resale value of which is not more than $4,000 at the max. His first love was the 1988 Chevrolet Blazer, which he loved to drive during his free time and he once drove to Seattle from New York in the same power-packed beast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>The list doesn&rsquo;t end here as more are lined up in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/do-you-know-which-cars-the-richest-billionaires-on-earth-own-%E2%80%93-part-2\">queue</a>!

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;The secret to a rich life is to have more beginnings than endings&rdquo;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mansions, private islands, boats, yachts, fancy cars, you name a luxury possession and they have it! Well, it&rsquo;s their accomplishment in their respective fields that have earned them the opulent status they are enjoying. For them, nothing in the world seems impossible to achieve, and here, please let&rsquo;s stick to the materialistic world only as it&rsquo;s not the right place to discuss spirituality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Carrying the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/do-you-know-which-cars-the-richest-billionaires-on-earth-own-\">list</a> forward that we were discussing the day before, it&rsquo;s time to bring in the other riches of the list, though in a different manner. Now let&rsquo;s not focus on the overseas billionaires but the ones who have made us Indians feel proud. Here are the top 5 billionaires across the nation and the vehicles they own:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mukesh Ambani (NW &ndash; $19.3 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mukesh-Ambani-with-Mercedes-SL500\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Mukesh-Ambani-with-Mercedes-SL500.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://cdn.pinthiscars.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If Dhirubhai Ambani would have been alive by now, the Reliance industry would have created the history by being at number one position in the <strong>top 10 richest billionaires of the world list with a combined net worth of $85 billion</strong>. It&rsquo;s not that Mukesh and Anil Ambani don&rsquo;t have that zeal and business tactics in them; it&rsquo;s just that they separated their ways soon after their father took his final abode.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming back to reality, rumors say that the<strong> Ambanis have a fleet of 168 premium cars</strong> (wow! That&rsquo;s sound like a huge figure). The ones that Mukesh Ambani loves to drive include all Mercedes-Benz&rsquo;s products and that too tailor-made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Mercedes-Benz SL500 and Mercedes Maybach 62 are among his favorites. Don&rsquo;t get swoon away after we tell you that Mukesh is also the owner of 3 jets, world&rsquo;s most expensive house and a yacht.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Azim Premji (NW &ndash; $15 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Azim-Premji-with-Ford-Escort\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Azim-Premji-with-Ford-Escort.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The chairman of the country&rsquo;s biggest public trading company, Wipro, is a simple man in terms of living and doesn&rsquo;t feel like displaying his wealth in the form of super luxury cars, like other riches do. He rather prefers donating his money for the good cause of charity. According to statistics, Azim Premji is not the second <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/india-billionaires/list/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">richest billionaire of India</a> as this position belongs to Dilip Shanghvi, the founder of Sun Pharmaceuticals. But being very secretive about his personal life, there is almost no information available about the cars that Dilip owns, so we have to make a leap jump to the third position, the one where Mr. Premji sits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first car that Azim Premji had was a Ford Escort, which he used for almost nine years before he brought a sedan from Toyota, Corolla, to replace the older one. Now comes a shocking revelation! <em><strong>Azim bought a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/e-class\">second hand Mercedes-Benz E-Class</a> from one of his employees to replace the Corolla.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hinduja Family (NW &ndash; $14.5 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Hinduja-Family-with-Aston-Martin\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Hinduja-Family-with-Aston-Martin.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The four brothers Srichand, Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok are the four pillars of Hinduja group who spread the root of the business in every possible dimension and gave birth to the highly diversified group. Right from Ashok Leyland Ltd. (automobile) to IndusInd Bank (financial), Hinduja brothers have left no stone unturned to rule the roost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">As far as their choice in terms of automobile is concerned, they seem to be big fans of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/aston-martin\">Aston Martins</a>. One of their Aston Martins is the one that won the Le Mans race in India &ndash; the Aston Martin Vantage GTE Endurance Race car.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pallonji Mistry (NW &ndash; $12.4 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Pallonji-Mistry-with-his-SUV\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Pallonji-Mistry-with-his-SUV.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://static1.businessinsider.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Dilip Shanghvi, the life of Pallonji Mistry from the very famous Shapoorji Pallonji Group, too revolves around mystery. Not much is available to the public about his likes and dislikes so finding the car he loves to drive or being chauffeured in is like an impossible task until you have connected sources (wink). Well all we know about this simple living high thinking man is that he shares a special liking for <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUVs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Laxmi Nivas Mittal (NW &ndash; $8.4 Billion)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Laxmi-Mittal-with-vanity-van\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Laxmi-Mittal-with-vanity-van.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:https://upload.wikimedia.org/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t the chairman of ArcelorMittal, the world&rsquo;s biggest steel manufacturing company? Laxmi Nivas Mittal is a man known for his smart business sense and of course by the huge number of houses and bungalows he has all across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well this man of steel owns a fleet of 20 cars that ranges from <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a> to Mercedes-Benz but the man caught the eyeballs through his luxurious vanity van that gives a tough competition to the one <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/cars-designed-by-dc-to-give-you-adrenaline-rush\">designed by DC for Shahrukh Khan</a>. The prized possessions of the Mittals include Porsche Boxster, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, a jet, luxury bus and 2 luxurious yachts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>The countdown has finally come to an end but with a note of self-realization. We all have that caliber and thrust inside us to do something extraordinary like these giants have done in their lives. All we need to do is &ndash; realize our strengths and hit the target just right there!</strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Who doesn't love the feeling of owning their very first car! The feeling is just indescribable. It&rsquo;s a thing that you&rsquo;ve dreamt of when you were a child. And, when the time finally comes, it just seems like the wait was well worth it. It could be a very simple family car or it could be a <a href=\"/sports\">stunning sports car</a> &ndash; the feeling remains the same.</p>\r\n<p>But did you know that there are some countries in the world where owning a car is even a bigger deal. Why, you ask? These are the countries where owning a family car could be even more expensive than <a href=\"/collection\">owning a luxury car</a> here. Shocked? Well, that doesn't make any less true.</p>\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The reason for such high prices could be the high taxes or the policies of the government that don't allow as much import of vehicles as there should be.</em></p>\r\n<p>Would you like to live in these countries? Probably not! Let&rsquo;s check out which these countries are so before you plan to change your citizenship, you don&rsquo;t end up choosing them. And the countdown begins:</p>\r\n<h2>8. CUBA</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Supercars in Cuba\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in--cuba.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://cdni.autocarindia.com/</span></div>\r\n<p>Cuba made its transformation to &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo; in 2011. With that it was expected that the prices of commodities might trickle down too. Disappointing as it was, very little progress could be made in the automotive sector. To the present day, it is the state that has all control over the sale of cars. A car like a <a href=\"https://www.peugeot.com/en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peugeot</a> will cost somewhere around Rs. 1,79,92,850. Crazy, right?</p>\r\n<h2>7. NORTH KOREA</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Supercars in North Korea\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in-north-korea.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://gtspirit.com/</span></div>\r\n<p>You know, how it&rsquo;s become almost a necessity for us to own a personal vehicle in the present day and age. Well, that is not the case when we talk about North Korea. Here when you own a car, you automatically fall into the category of &ldquo;Elite&rdquo;. This is precisely due to economic problem and restrictions by the government in the region. The country has always had a bad relationship with cars.</p>\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Due to <a href=\"/car-news/green-signal-to-diesel-cars-in-national-capital-with-green-cess--reports\">restrictions imposed by government</a>, it is not easy to own a car by ordinary people. The only people you would find driving cars in this region are the people with political background or people with deep pockets. Oh, did we forget to mention because of this the prices of cars are outrageous!</em></p>\r\n<h2>6. ST. KITTS &amp; NEVIS</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Supercars in St. Kitts &amp; Nevis\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in-st.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://gtspirit.com/</span></div>\r\n<p>This is a beautiful island located in West Indies. The roads are so gorgeous you&rsquo;d want to keep driving. But the sad fact is that the cars here are extremely expensive due to high importing rates. Because of high prices of new cars &ndash; this place is all about <a href=\"/mercedes-benz\">used cars</a>!</p>\r\n<h2>5. UK</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Supercars in UK\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in--uk.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://static.independent.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n<p>Surprised to see this name in the list? Well, don&rsquo;t be. The rates of cars are high, to make it worse, the insurance rates are so over the top that your pockets might force you to leave the place altogether.</p>\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">The prices are almost double than rest of Europe. One good thing, however, is that you can easily afford used cars. The reason for their cheap price is that nowhere else in Europe, people are right hand drivers.</em></p>\r\n<p>Looking for the remaining ones? <a href=\"/blog/8-most-expensive-places-in-the-world-to-buy-own-a-car-part-2\">Click here</a></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a Car Junkie, there are some places in the world where you just don&rsquo;t want to end up living! The prices of cars are so high here, that they leave us breathless. We have made our minds, we are not shifting to these places anytime soon. What do you say? In the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/8-most-expensive-places-in-the-world-to-buy-own-a-car\">previous blog</a>, we discussed some of these places, here we bring you the top four most expensive countries in the world to Own and Buy a car. Don&rsquo;t say you weren&#39;t warned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. BRAZIL</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"supercars-in-brazil\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in-brazil.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://gtspirit.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Insanely high cost of labor, taxes, and scarce availability of spare parts, makes Brazil a country where automobile is not easy to afford. To help you understand better, let&rsquo;s compare: A <a href=\"https://www.toyotabharat.com/showroom/corolla-altis/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Corolla</a> that cost around $16,000 in the Unites States of America will cost around $25,000 here. So, if you ever have plans on living in this country, don&rsquo;t say you weren&rsquo;t warned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. NICARAGUA</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"supercars-in-nicaragua\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in-nicaragua.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://gtspirit.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">If you happen to be at this place, we&rsquo;d advise you to not <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">buy a car</a> here. Paying more than thousands of dollars for a 20 year old beater, how ridiculously high the prices are! No, we&rsquo;re not kidding.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. INDONESIA</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"supercars-in-indonesia\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in-indonesia.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://cdn.hawknpoke.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The average starting rate for cars is around $60,000. So if you&rsquo;ve known a person who owns a car in Indonesia, you now will know how wealthy they actually are!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. SINGAPORE</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"supercars-in-singapore\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/supercars-in-singapore.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://gtspirit.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a car junkie and living in Singapore, we really feel for you! Singapore has been considered by many, as one of the worst places to buy and own a car in the world. In fact, if you buy a Prius from <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/toyota\">Toyota</a> (a small <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/hola-nio-ep9%E2%80%93the-world-s-fastest-electric-supercar\">hybrid electric car</a>) here, be prepared to shell out around $154,000 very easily. Regulations by government such as putting a 100% tax make it extremely hard to buy a car here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Every country has its own rules and regulations and it&rsquo;s really hard to find a place as perfect as heaven. Commuting has really become a worldwide issue considering the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/traffic-rules-get-stricter;-up-to-10x-hike-in-challans\">heavy traffic jams</a> and long travelling time. To curb this menacing issue, these countries surely have taken a smart step but will it prove to be effective, only the time will tell.</em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail&rdquo; &ndash; Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many of us this is an inspirational quote but some of us have taken it quite sincerely. On a serious note, what is our definition for car lovers? The ones who <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/do-you-know-which-cars-the-richest-billionaires-on-earth-own-%E2%80%93-part-2\">own a fleet of luxury cars</a> or are passionate about cars and their details? Well, in this race we are completely underestimating those who have gone beyond the line to show how much crazy they are. There are people who love cars and then there are people who love travelling, but have you ever imagined what the outcome will be if both of them are combined?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are any names or images of famous celebs coming to your mind? We hope not, because this field entirely belongs to those who do not go for popularity but to satiate their love for car and travelling. We have prepared of list of such <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/who-are-the-biggest-petrolhead-celebrities-ever-find-out\">crazy petrolheads</a> who have created histories in their own way. Let&rsquo;s meet them:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Team L.I.F.E &ndash; The Baids</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Team L.I.F.E â€“ The Baids\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/baids-trip-to-france-2.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://i.dailymail.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px;\">11 Countries, 50 cities, 111 days, 14,154 miles</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start the list with our own countrymen. Yes, the Baid family from Bangalore, Anand, Punita and their two kids &ndash; Yash (12) and Dhriti (8), went to a trip of their lifetime. From India to France their by-road journey was full of adventure and risks but trusting their will, the family didn&rsquo;t give up. <font style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">They named their team as L.I.F.E. which means Little Indian Family of Explorers.</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The family drove across 11 countries and 50 cities in their <font style=\"font-size:24px; font-weight:bold;\">trusty Fiat Linea Tjet</font>, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">a sedan</a>, survived an earthquake, passed the Himalayas in Tibet, witnessed the largest burning cater of the world, Door to Hell, in Turkmenistan, mounted the sand-dunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"trusty Fiat Linea Tjet\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/baids-trip-to-france-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://i.dailymail.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the route they took &ndash; <em class=\"redText\">from India -&gt; Nepal -&gt; China -&gt; Kyrgyzstan -&gt; Uzbekistan -&gt; Turkmenistan -&gt; Iran -&gt; Turkey -&gt; Greece -&gt; Italy -&gt; Spain and finally to their destination, France.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Punita Baid shared her experience about the planning of this long trip and said, <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;At first I thought Anand was joking when he mentioned Bangalore to Paris by road. Little did I know he would return back in couple months with a bunch of papers in hand with everything charted out explaining how it could be done.&rdquo;</em> She further added, <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;As much as I love going on long family drives, this for me was unheard of and with kids onboard &ndash; you never know what kind of unexpected challenges can occur.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"baids-trip-to-france-4\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/baids-trip-to-france-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://i.dailymail.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the family, the best part of travelling by car is that they have the flexibility of spending as much time as they wanted to at a particular place. On top of it, their car became their best assistant and did not behave at all like a spoiled brat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>The moment when they were driving past the Nepal-China border was the scariest one because they got stuck there due to the earthquake tremors. All this forced them to sleep in their car for 5 nights because of the damaged roads.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenge for the hardcore vegetarians was finding the vegetarian food.

The best part of travelling is that you make new friends, learn new culture, explore the unexplored areas and above all you meet the new you, which is best thing that can ever happen to you. And when you are doing it with your soulmate, here we mean your priced possession i.e. your car, the experience fourfold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are discussing about those crazy travelers who are in most sense car lovers too and in the last blog our pick was the Indian family that drove from <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/this-is-what-happens-when-there-resides-a-traveler-inside-a-crazy-car-lover-1\">Bangalore to Paris in their Fiat Linea</a>. Our next member in the list is a person who seems to have been born for travelling and driving. Let&rsquo;s meet the man who has changed the way one can ever pursue his/her passion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gunther, Christine and their OTTO</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Gunther, Christine and their OTTO\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Otto's-long-journey-2.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://www.outsideonline.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px;\">6 Continents, 215 Countries, 26 Years, 900,000 Kilometers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gunther Holtorf who has spent a good time of 23 years travelling around the globe in his Otto is now popularly known as the <font style=\"font-size:22px; color:#000;\"><em>World&rsquo;s Greatest Traveler</em></font>. Otto is the name of the car in which he covered his long journey with his wife, which lasted for around 26 years. It was none other than the 1988 Mercedes G Wagon, which is not a part of the Mercedes-Benz museum in Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em style=\" text-decoration:underline;\">Gunther has nearly spent 3 years of his life being behind the wheel of his Otto and his attachment with the 3-litre 5-cylinder diesel-powered long wheelbase Mercedes 300 GD that was capable of churning out a peak power of 88hp.</em> Throughout the voyage, the Otto witnessed many minor accidents which end up giving nothing more than a dent to the off-roader and this is what something that makes the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes cars</a> special.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ad3mbgqmCg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"the Mercedes cars special\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Otto's-long-journey-5.png\" /> </a><span class=\"imgRef\">https://icdn-7.motor1.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The trio set their journey back in 1988 and their first destination was Kenya. The trip that was planned to last for 2 years lasted for around 5 years in Africa. And then the never-lasting journey began. From New Zealand to Australia to India to Brazil and the countries and destinations kept on adding one after the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toughness of Otto is well described in the words of Gunther (2013) &ndash; <em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;Otto is nothing but nuts and bolts that means I can unscrew the nuts and pull out bolts to repair anything that comes up myself&rdquo;</em>. He further added, <em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;In any modern car you cannot touch the brakes because it&rsquo;s all electronically controlled.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the words of Gunthe\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Otto's-long-journey-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\"> https://www.bbc.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Gunther and Christine have confessed that they have treated the Mercedes G Wagon as their old grandmother and never raised the odometer hand by 80kmph (50mph). As a result, even after travelling a gigantic distance of 900,000 kilometers the Otto didn&rsquo;t end up drinking the oil, the engine cylinders never underwent re-lining and the piston remained the original one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right from facing the wrath of the mud hole to fighting the malign facial tumor that Christine got detected, the Holtrofs confronted every challenge that came up to their way. Unfortunately Christine&rsquo;s situation worsened and she succumbed to her disease in June 2010. The remaining journey Gunther and Martin, their son, continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ottoâ€™s Journey\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Otto's-long-journey-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\"> https://www.bbc.co.uk/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>For complete information on the adventure the Holtrofs had on the 26-years lasting world tour, visit their blog &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.ottosreise.de/en/start.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Otto&rsquo;s Journey</a>.</strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Decades ago traveling alone for a woman was a big taboo in many of the societies, including India too. Another myth that still persists in our society about women is that they are the <font style=\"font-size:25px; font-weight:bold;\">WORST DRIVERS</font>. Well, we hope this myth will be debunked soon!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing with <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/this-is-what-happens-when-there-resides-a-traveler-inside-a-crazy-car-lover-%E2%80%93-ii\">the list</a> that we left yesterday, today we would like to cover something special. Something that might attract the eyes of many! Where on one hand we will discuss the 3 Indian women who showed their courage to travel to London from Delhi in an <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUV</a>, on the other there are two men who set out to attempt a world record in traveling. Amazing! So let&rsquo;s start:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Women Beyond Boundaries (WBB)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"travelers-who-are-car-lovers-2\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/travelers-who-are-car-lovers-2.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px;\">2 Continents, 17 Countries, 95 Days, 21,477 Kilometers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nidhi Tiwari, Rashmi Gururaja Koppar and Dr. Soumya Gopinath are the three adventurous women who set out to explore the world of traveling in 95 days. The trio in their mid-30s decided to make their dream come alive and to show the world the power of women. The interesting thing about the three besties is that all of them are mothers but that didn&rsquo;t stop them from chasing their long-time dream. And their ultimate companion for the long cross-border journey was <font style=\"font-size:25px; font-weight:bold;\">Mahindra First Choice SUV.</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trio that is a part of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/womenbeyondboundaries/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WBB</a> started their journey in June 2015 that came to an end in October 2015. The entire trip was sponsored by the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Lenovo India, Mahindra First Choice Wheels, Tea Trails India, @Round Table India Area 6, Via.com, Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and SEEW (Social Empowerment by Empowering Women).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"travelers-who-are-car-lovers-3\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/travelers-who-are-car-lovers-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://d2847ql9t214mi.cloudfront.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout their journey, the all-female group stayed with the local families and had homemade food and in this way the <em>POWERPUFF GIRLS</em> maintain their faith in humanity. This journey comprised of 2 continents (or one can say 4, considering the transcontinental nature of France) &ndash; Asia and Europe &ndash; and 17 countries, which include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">Myanmar -&gt; China -&gt; Kyrgyzstan -&gt; Uzbekistan -&gt; Kazakhstan -&gt; Russia -&gt; Finland -&gt; Estonia -&gt; Latvia -&gt; Lithuania -&gt; Poland -&gt; Czech Republic -&gt; Germany -&gt; Belgium -&gt; France -&gt; UK.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"travelers-who-are-car-lovers-4\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/travelers-who-are-car-lovers-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://d2847ql9t214mi.cloudfront.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">An Indian car on the roads of London</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nidhi, who was behind the wheel of Mahindra SUV throughout the journey, said, <em class=\"dimText\">&ldquo;Driving has been a passion. It is absolutely therapeutic for me to be behind the wheel. I have built my own vehicle almost 10 years ago. So, I had both the skill and the urge to drive in tough conditions.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Two Stepbrothers and World Record Attempt</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"travelers-who-are-car-lovers-5\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/travelers-who-are-car-lovers-5.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://i2.wp.com/london-capetown.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px;\">2 Continents, 18 Countries, 13 Days, 10,000 Miles</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two stepbrothers <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/a-road-trip-through-18-countries-in-land-rover-discovery-2\">attempted to break the world record</a> of 10 days, 3 hours and 16 minutes. Though they couldn&rsquo;t achieve what they wanted, they end up gaining some precious memories and taming the roads less taken. Two men, Paul Hanson and George Coleman, with their <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/land-rover/discovery\">Land Rover Discovery</a> 2 TD5 started their journey this year from 15th of January, which lasted till the 28th of January, 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"travelers-who-are-car-lovers-6\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/travelers-who-are-car-lovers-6.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://scontent.fdel1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>From London to Capetown, the route these brothers took was full of challenges but they overcame every hurdle and came out as true winners, though not on papers. The reason why they chose <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/land-rover\">Land Rover</a> for their journey was simply the easy availability of its service centers in almost every continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"travelers-who-are-car-lovers-7\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/travelers-who-are-car-lovers-7.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://d1knsp9ts2npjt.cloudfront.net/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Their 1999 Land Rover Discovery Series 2 has a bullet-proof engine with R380 gearbox. The off-roader was modified to accommodate a diesel engine of 200 litres capacity with an electric pumping system. The brothers also added extra guards and protectors to fourfold the safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 18 countries that Paul and George covered during their world record breaking attempt include,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">London -&gt; France -&gt; Spain -&gt; Morocco -&gt; Western Sahara -&gt; Mauritania -&gt; Senegal -&gt; Mali -&gt; Burkina Faso -&gt; Benin -&gt; Nigeria -&gt; Cameroon -&gt; Gabon -&gt; Republic of Congo -&gt; Democratic Republic of Congo -&gt; Angola -&gt; Namibia -&gt; South Africa.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"travelers-who-are-car-lovers-8\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/travelers-who-are-car-lovers-8.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://london-capetown.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>The list will never come to an end as more crazy travelers will keep on joining the bandwagon to discover new stories. But as of now our side of list has ended. Some more interesting stories related to the automobile industry are waiting for you.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get one thing clear &ndash; When you own a Rolls-Royce, it&#39;s not like you own any other supercar. If you&rsquo;re riding around in a Rolls-Royce, you&rsquo;ve got to be ready for some judgments, and some of them can be envious ones. Without you even having to say a word, you can totally expect people to put you in the category of &ldquo;<strong style=\"color:#000;\">Sir</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong style=\"color:#000;\">Madam</strong>&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in the 1900&rsquo;s that <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/rolls-royce\">Rolls-Royce</a> earned the status of the car for the &ldquo;Elite&rdquo;. Its exclusivity makes it sound something like Bourneville &ndash; You don&rsquo;t just buy a Rolls-Royce, you&rsquo;ve got to really earn it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">So now that we&rsquo;ve got you all excited, we don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be fair to keep you waiting more. Here are some facts about Rolls-Royce that will leave you spellbound</em>:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Out of all Rolls-Royce ever produced, 65% are still on road.</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Rools-Royce-on-road\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Rools-Royce-on-road.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://www.motorvend.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people say that this is due to the fantastic craftsmanship and engine that the supercars keep going on and on. Whatever is the reason behind this <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/facts-about-cars-to-leave-you-awestruck-part-2\">fact</a>, we&rsquo;d say that this is a mind-blowing use of resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-bottom:0px;\">2. Rolls-Royce used as a Garbage Collector&hellip; WHAAAT!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We know it sounds terribly crazy but then again, there are all kinds of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/this-is-what-happens-when-there-resides-a-traveler-inside-a-crazy-car-lover-%E2%80%93-ii\">crazies in the world</a>. A ruler named Jai Singh (Maharaja of Princely state of India) got highly offended by a Rolls-Royce salesman (who told him he couldn&#39;t afford a Rolls-Royce). The man got so angry, he shipped 10 of these beauties and started using them as <strong style=\"font-size:22px; color:#000;\">Garbage Collectors</strong> until Rolls-Royce apologized!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Bull Skin is used for Rolls-Royce Upholstery</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Rolls-Royce-Upholestory\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Rolls-Royce-Upholestory.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://www.rrsilvershadow.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>And by that we mean <strong style=\"font-size:22px; color:#000;\">ONLY bull skin</strong>. It takes about 8 bulls to complete the upholstery for one Rolls-Royce. Shocked? Well, so are we! These bulls are raised especially in Europe, which means away from all insects and mosquitoes. So, the upholstery you get is of the topnotch quality. That&rsquo;s the level of detailing the company goes into.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-bottom:0px;\">4. Hong Kong owns the most number of Rolls-Royce EVER!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s true. Hong Kong used to be a British colony &ndash; and most of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/do-you-know-which-cars-the-richest-billionaires-on-earth-own-%E2%80%93-part-2\">wealthy businessmen</a> and officers owned this supercar maybe due to its undeniable <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\"><em>&ldquo;Elite&rdquo; </em></strong>Status symbol.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. The coachline of the supercar is painted by one man only</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"royal-royce-only-one-man-paints\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/royal-royce-only-one-man-paints.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">https://i.ytimg.com/</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that Rolls-Royce is not fond of automated stuff and machines. They appreciate the value of a human hand and this is probably why, there is just one man, who goes by the name <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/30/autos/rolls-royce-stripe-painter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Court</a> who is entitled to paint the <em style=\" color:#000;\">coachline of Rolls-Royce</em>. Some serious level of exclusivity, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-bottom:0px;\">6. A Special training programme for the chauffeurs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">One thing that Rolls-Royce values the most is that your driving experience should be just the best. That is why, the company arranged a <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\">special programme</strong> that helps chauffeurs bring out their skills. These chauffeurs are taught etiquettes so as to make your driving experience dreamlike.</em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The handsome hunk grabbed attention from his movie, <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\"><em>Dhoom</em></strong>, which was a splendid success in the country. In the movie, you have seen him riding the best bikes around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, that very presence and aura of superbikes created that craze and excitement among the youth of India, to someday own a bike like the Suzuki Hayabusa once in their lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"John himself is an avid biker\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/John-Abraham-with-his-cars-and-bikes-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorbeam</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>John himself is an avid biker and never once compromises on long Sunday rides. He has a wondrous collection of superbikes available in the country and to name some &ndash; Hayabusa and <a href=\"https://www.kawasaki.com/products/2017-Ninja-ZX-14R-ABS\" target=\"_blank\">Kawasaki ZX 14r</a> are among his favorites. Now it can&rsquo;t be that love and passion are stuck up at one end only, and that&rsquo;s definitely not the case here because John is also a proud owner of a <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\"><em>Lamborghini Gallardo</em></strong>. Truly what&rsquo;s the icing on the cake is when you see a superstar of such a high caliber getting out of a supercar that screams attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AWESOME! Isn&rsquo;t it? For John, life begins after <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">owning a Lamborghini</a>. For a motorcyclist the urge to have something unique and special gets satiated with a black Lambo, which surely elevates&nbsp;his passion to cloud nine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A Special Companion for Life</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The spitfire Gallardo LP 550-2 in John's exotic garage \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/John-Abraham-with-his-cars-and-bikes-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - Youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gallardo is like a love story for John because he drives it every alternate night, keeping in mind his busy schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is also of the opinion that <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercars</a> of these categories need to be driven extremely carefully in crowded cities like Mumbai and Delhi and parents need to play a catalytic role in guiding their children on the safety aspects of these cars and the importance of following the traffic rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">The spitfire&nbsp;Gallardo LP 550-2 in John&#39;s exotic garage is powered by a 5.2-litre V10 that produces 550PS and 540Nm of torque mated to&nbsp;a six-speed automated manual&nbsp;gearbox and&nbsp;can do a 0-100kmph run in 3.9&nbsp;seconds together&nbsp;with going&nbsp;on to hit a top speed of 320kmph. Your adrenaline rush is surely at its peak once you get a scintillating experience of the mind boggling power being channeled enthusiastically to the rear wheels. (Coz it is a RWD Gallardo).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get better than this, trust us! And all you have to do is just spot a Lamborghini on the road and the mighty roar and sound from those exhausts can be a crowd puller from quite some kilometers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you can imagine very well that how much fun and enjoyment one derives from driving a Lamborghini, especially for a car passionate like John.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has also been an avid lover for <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUVs</a> and used to own the Tata Sierra and the Maruti Suzuki Gypsy but somewhere in mind always had that grit and determination to make it big in life and own a Gallardo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Glimpse of the Beast</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"This Lamborghini\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/John-Abraham-with-his-cars-and-bikes-5.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - bharathautos</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">This Lamborghini&rsquo;s design is simply unmistakable. Although trained eyes and enthusiasts will be able to distinguish it from the new and modern Huracan, recently launched in India, the former is leaps and bounds ahead of its rivals. Be it architecture, engine performance and practicality, the rivals can take a back seat for now because on such special moments we often have the heart ruling over the head.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the interior front\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/John-Abraham-with-his-cars-and-bikes-6.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - topgear</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>On the interior front, again the Gallardo doesn&rsquo;t fail to impress because as soon as you get inside, an <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\"><em>F1 Racer</em></strong> quickly emerges in you, ready to burn the tarmac. Even for people who are driving a Lamborghini for the very first time in their life, they will not find it difficult to find the right driving position with the steering wheel spot on&nbsp;in their hands and&nbsp;all the controls placed ergonomically on the central console and dashboard. Again, you sit a bit low but the excellent cushioning and material used on the seats cocoon you in absolute comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summing it up in the end, we believe there is no car other than a Lamborghini, which can truly make a person&rsquo;s day and we can truly make out that John Abraham is having a wonderful experience every time he takes out his Gallardo out for a spin. Some things in life are truly made for sheer enjoyment that is further accentuated when one possesses the willpower and determination to attain those luxuries by sheer hard work and focus &ndash; the same that has been beautifully exemplified by John!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini the Car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/John-Abraham-with-his-cars-and-bikes-7.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\"><strong>As far as Lamborghini is concerned, it is a perfect epitome of power, aggression, exclusivity, rarity &amp; pride.</strong></em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Held annually near the town of Le Mans in France since 1923, it is considered to be <strong>world&rsquo;s oldest active endurance racing</strong> event. The circuit of the race is called <strong>Circuit De La Sarthe</strong> that consists of public roads that are open throughout the year to the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Twenty-Four Hours of Le Mans\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Best-race-tracks-2.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - wikipedia</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This race goes on for 24 hours putting the cars under pressure and testing their racing endurance.

Now the Nordschleife has been refurbished in accordance with the FIA&rsquo;s safety guidelines. Now f1 teams from <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> to Mclaren ply on this track to hunt for the ultimate f1 rush.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#1 Isle Of Man</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzQLl9cLt6A\" width=\"860\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Biker&rsquo;s from around the world worship the Isle of Man and consider it to be the world&#39;s most dangerous and revered race track.

Vivus was an electric vehicle where the internal combustion engine was used as a generator.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche-Sascha\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Porsche-Sascha.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Ferdinand Porsche also broke the myth that smaller cars can&rsquo;t be powerful and speedy than <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">bigger vehicles</a>. <em style=\"font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;\">Sascha</em> was the live example! Significantly smaller than the size of its competitors in the race, Sascha won 43 races, which include the 1922 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targa_Florio\">Targa Florio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferdinand was also the brain behind a 4-wheeldrive Formula One car, though it couldn&rsquo;t make up to the track due to lack of funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz-type-80\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Mercedes-Benz-type-80.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Just for your information, the that-time-to-be fastest car on the globe, <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">Mercedes-Benz Type 80</em>, was actually designed by Ferdinand Porsche in 1939. The car was supposed to hit the top speed mark of 470mph. Now we get to know that he was not boasting when he said &ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find the sportscar of my dream, so I built it myself&rdquo;</em><em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> &ndash; Ferdinand Porsche</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"logo-of-Ferrari-and-Porsche\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/logo-of-Ferrari-and-Porsche.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Ferrari and Porsche share same passion and love for <em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">&ldquo;Horse Power&rdquo;</em> as the crests of both the brands have a prancing horse. Where Porsche owns the right to use it (related to City of Stuttgart), Ferrari uses it as a luck charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ferdinand Porsche\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Porsche-911.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>6. We all know how popular and demanding Porsche 911 is but do you know that it was not the actual name? The car was first introduced in 1963 and was named as <em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">901 </em>but due to the patent nomenclature claim by Peugeot, Porsche had to change the name to 911.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"worldâ€™s first chronograph watch in black color\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Porscheâ€™s-first-black-chronograph-watch.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Not only the automobile industry but Porsche Design has its first say in the fashion industry too as Porsche was the first company to introduce<em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">world&rsquo;s first chronograph watch</em> in black color.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini-designed-tractors\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Porsche-designed-tractors.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>8. You might think that <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/things-you-didn%E2%80%99t-know-about-lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> made a niche for itself with its tractors but you are highly mistaken as this title too was snatched by Porsche. Yes, Porsche was into the <em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">designing of tractors</em> and believe our words its history is way more interesting than that of Lamborghini.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The popular and powerful bike maker, Harley Davidson\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Harley-Davidson-V-Rod.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>9. The popular and powerful bike maker, Harley Davidson too appreciates Porsche Design&rsquo;s technology. The superbike manufacturing company uses some of Porsche&rsquo;s engines in few of their bikes, including the mighty<em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\"> Harley V-Rod</em>. The engine for this bike was specially designed by Porsche for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche-Designed-grill\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Porsche-Designed-grill.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">Source:google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Well, another weird yet interesting exploration by this automobile manufacturer. For those Porsche lovers who are foodies too, Porsche has also<em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/cars-designed-by-dc-to-give-you-adrenaline-rush\">DESIGNED</a> A GRILL</em>! Astound? So are we!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Serving its clientele in a very special and kingly manner, Porsche is the only brand that offers customization in exterior colors of the Porsche cars. Choose the color you want your Porsche in and here it is! All you have to do is &ndash; pay extra bucks for the special service.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; float: none;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;I am not weird, I'm Limited Edition&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>In India, meeting weird people is nothing new, especially when you are on the busiest roads of metropolitan cities, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bangalore. But India isn&rsquo;t the only country full of weirdest things as the whole world too stands in competition, especially when it comes to <em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\">cars and rules</em> around them.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s good to have a clear understanding of the <a href=\"/car-news/traffic-rules-get-stricter;-up-to-10x-hike-in-challans\">traffic rules and regulations of your own country</a> but it&rsquo;s not enough. If you think that driving the road&rsquo;s right or the left side is the only thing you have to keep in mind while driving abroad, you are highly mistaken! There are some places in the world with weird driving laws that may make you go crazy. So here is a list of some fanatic laws around cars you might need to be aware of before you plan a trip to that country or city.</p>\r\n<h2>Headlights ON</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"headlight-on-in-daytime\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/headlight-on-in-daytime.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - metrotechcollision</span></div>\r\n<p>In Sweden, it is necessary for you to keep the headlights of your car ON every time your car is on the road. Yes, you have to keep it on even if the day is sunny!</p>\r\n<h2>Say NO to Dirty Car</h2>\r\n<p>If you are planning a trip to Russia, you should be aware of the fact that driving a <a href=\"/blog/facts-about-cars-to-leave-you-awestruck\">dirty car in Russia</a> can invite a fine of <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2,000 Roubles</em> (approx. Rs. 3,400). You get it right, it&rsquo;s an offense there!</p>\r\n<h2>Used Underwear to Wipe a Car? Think Again!</h2>\r\n<p>As an Indian, you can pretty well understand what we are trying to say. Being blessed with the capability to make optimum usage of resources at our disposal, many of us have actually done it. But in San Francisco, California, it&rsquo;s illegal to <a href=\"/auto-guide/how-to-take-royal-care-of-your-loyal-supercar\">wipe your car</a> with a <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">used underwear</em>.</p>\r\n<h2>Drunk? Take Back Seat</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"passengers-sitting-back-seat-drunk\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/passengers-sitting-back-seat.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>In Macedonia, if you are under the influence of alcohol, you are not allowed to sit in front. This is the law that needs to be implemented in India. Do you want to know why? Well, remember your drunk friend saying &ndash;<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&ldquo;Gaadi tera bhai chalayega ab!&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<h2>No WOMEN Driver in Saudi Arabia</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"no-muslim-woman-driving-saudi-arabia\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/muslim-woman-driving.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>We all know how many restrictions are being imposed on women in many parts of the world but it seems like Saudi Arabia is trying to top the chart by being<em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\"> UNIQUE</em>. It is the only country to put a ban on women from driving a car. Now we should be proud of our country where 3 women went to London by car by driving in their <a href=\"/suv\">SUV</a>!</p>\r\n<h2>Monday Blues</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"number-plate-ending-with-1\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/number-plate-ending-with-1.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>In Manila, if your car&rsquo;s number plate is ending with either 1 or 2, you are not allowed to take your car out for a drive or to <em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\">work on Monday</em>.</p>\r\n<h2>Have Parking Space? You Can Buy a Car</h2>\r\n<p>This is another law that our government should seriously think of imposing on Indians! Coming back to the fact, Japan doesn&rsquo;t allow its citizens to <a href=\"/collection\">buy a car</a> if they don&rsquo;t have a <em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\">parking space</em>&nbsp;for the car. Also, if you are riding a car with a drunken driver, you too are entitled to fine and punishment, irrespective of the fact whether you are under the influence of alcohol or not.</p>\r\n<h2>Don&rsquo;t Drink and Eat While Driving</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"drinking-water-while-driving\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/drinking-water-while-driving.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>No, here we are not talking about the alcohol but the essential drink we all need &ndash; WATER. Yes, you read it right! In Cyprus, <em><strong>you cannot drink even water</strong></em> or eat anything when you are behind the wheel.</p>\r\n<h2>Not Easy to Buy Car in Shanghai</h2>\r\n<p>Seeing the increasing number of vehicles and traffic on roads, the government of Shanghai has taken an extreme step recently to discourage the <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/miscellaneous/Shanghai-further-tightens-rules-to-buy-cars/articleshow/52820394.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\">purchase of new vehicles</a>. Now you can only buy a car in the city if you are its<em><strong> resident since 3 years</strong></em> and carry and uninterrupted history of social security and income tax payments for 3 years.</p>\r\n<h2>Habitual of Honking? Don&rsquo;t Visit New York</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"yelling-in-traffic-jam\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/peo-yelling-in-traffic-jam.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - media-property</span></div>\r\n<p>Another law that we all feel should have been a part of India&rsquo;s traffic rules. In New York, you are not allowed to honk unnecessarily else you may end up paying a hefty fine of $350. In fact, in Rockville, Maryland, cursing and yelling in public is illegal and may levy on you a heavy penalty of $100 (approx. Rs. 6,750) or a<em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\"> jail of up to 90 days</em>.</p>\r\n<h2>No Traffic Rules for Non-Motorized Vehicles</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"cycle-breaking-traffic-light\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/cycle-breaking-traffic-light.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>So India is there in the list! Yes, in India no traffic violation laws can be imposed on <em><strong>non-motorized vehicles</strong></em>, which include bicycles, rickshaws, etc. This is because they don&rsquo;t fall in the Motor Vehicles Act. So, now we all have the answer why rickshaw pullers and cyclists don&rsquo;t care violating the traffic light and rules.</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",

When you&lsquo;ve worked hard all your life, then pampering yourself to the fullest is not a bad thing &amp; that is represented by his <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercar collection</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>I. Rolls-Royce Ghost</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The charm &amp; elegance of the<em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\"> &lsquo;British Palace on Wheels&rsquo;</em> is a perfect epitome of the English culture &amp; heritage. It is a perfect machine that goes aptly with a superstar&rsquo;s personality &amp; success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mere presence &amp; humongous length leaves a remarkable impression in the admirer&rsquo;s sub conscious mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/rolls-royce/ghost\">The Ghost</a> boasts of a 563bhp 6592cc twin turbo<em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\"> V12 engine</em> with a 0-100kmph timing of 5 seconds approximately &amp; that&rsquo;s literally in the sports car category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there cannot be any better &amp; special occasion other than one&rsquo;s birthday to swivel around the beauty &amp; aura of the &lsquo;Spirit of Ecstasy&rsquo; signage along with making it your priced possession lifelong.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Rolls-Royce-Ghost\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Rolls-Royce-Ghost.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - metrotechcollision</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hrithik on his 42nd birthday, gifted himself the latest iteration of the Rolls-Royce Ghost in a striking blue shade by paying a whopping <em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">Rs. 7 Crore</em> &amp; became the latest superstar to enter the list of renowned achievers owning this masterpiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>II. Mercedes-Benz S-Class</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz-S-Class\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Mercedes-Benz-S-Class.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This vehicle stays true to the tagline of the company &lsquo;the best or nothing&rsquo; and again conforming&nbsp;well with the decision making capabilities of the superstar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If one has to choose the first rate&nbsp;or ultimate, then it has to be a three pointed star for sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been the obvious choice for corporate honchos &amp; world leaders from the very beginning &amp; even our Bollywood stars cannot help but get mesmerized by the legendary badge value of an S-Class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This magnificent example from the Stuttgart manufacturer is a perfect embodiment of timeless design, innovation, safety, status &amp; reckoning with the fact that it looks a bit understated compared to its flamboyant rivals, it still is a clear cut preference for many buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The example owned by Hrithik is a W222 S500 model sporting a massive<em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\"> 4.7-litre V8 petrol engine </em>producing 463bhp with an earth shattering 700Nm of torque &amp; capable of breaking some serious records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actor decided to go for this flagship model because while driving his father&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, he unluckily met with an accident and&nbsp;came out unhurt, all thanks to the tried &amp; tested safety features that stood gurdian. At last going by the company&rsquo;s symbol, it conveys a whole hearted drive towards universal motorization &amp; domination, thereby giving a strong reflection of highly successful people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>III. Ferrari Modena</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ferrari-Modena\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Ferrari-Modena.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - team-bhp</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever dreamt of burning some rubber &amp; generating smoke? We are pretty sure that you would definitely like to if you encounter this classic Italian sportster for a few hours that will leave you spellbound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhaust note will ignite one&rsquo;s inner senses &amp; enthusiasm to unleash the mighty raring surge&nbsp;within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design language is simply unmistakably a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> &amp; engages you even further to appreciate its curvaceous body &amp; the&nbsp;low stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Housing a <em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">3.6L V8</em> motor having 400bhp, it is capable of doing a 0-100 sprint in just 4.5 seconds &amp;&nbsp;attaining a top speed of 305km/hr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is ludicrously quick but for media journalists &amp; critics, keeping in mind its design language &amp; performance abilities, it qualifies as&nbsp;the perfect example to be Schumacher&rsquo;s weekender getaway car. This being the same car which Hrithik is found to be driving in his debut film <em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">&lsquo;Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai&rsquo;</em> &amp; subsequently made it an inevitable part of his exotic collection due to the fun &amp; craze factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>IV. Maserati Spyder</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Maserati-Spyder\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Maserati-Spyder.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - allfotocars </span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve always been huge fans of that big wide elliptical shaped chrome grille that houses one of the world&rsquo;s most respected &amp; honored logos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maserati&#39;s Trident signage with the three upward pointed spears convey a deep meaning &amp; significance of the city Bologna where the great inception took place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It definitely doesn&rsquo;t get better than this, <strong>having your favorite Maserati with an open roof top <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\">convertible</a> form that oozes dynamism &amp; sportiness</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its the sporty Maserati Spyder!!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These timeless pieces from Italy have always been praised for their singular poise&nbsp;&amp; this being no different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equipped with a 4244cc engine churning out 390PS&nbsp;of unadulterated power &amp; fulfilling the honors of an energetic showdown, the Spyder automatically regained a raring to go&nbsp;image in the enthusiast&rsquo;s minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Hrithik&#39;s regal and time honored exotics!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Later on, the Spyder went on to became the <a href=\"https://india.maserati.com/maserati/in/en/models/granturismo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gran Turismo</a> exemplifying class &amp; elegance as a perfect<em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">Roman Maestro</em> is expected to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>V. Porsche Cayenne Turbo</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche-Cayenne-Turbo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Porsche-Cayenne-Turbo.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - blogspot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>On hearing the name <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche\">Porsche</a>, only one thing comes to mind &amp; that being &lsquo;There is no substitute&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has been portrayed in almost every startling model of their lineup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cayenne <strong>being one model from the German manufacturer </strong>can be regarded as an entry for people into the Porsche lineage along with being a portrayer of&nbsp;one of the best in class design, performance, quality &amp; unmatched ownership experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Turbo variant, being vastly different from the run-of-the-mill Cayenne variants, simply engages one to go hard at the pedal. It will surely put a big smile on your face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same, it is a fusion of dynamic sportiness &amp; practicality, intending to say that one can drive it effortlessly in the midst of bumper-to-bumper traffic, while at the same time exhibit all its potential on an open stretch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its mere presence &amp; revving note simply outclasses the rivals to a great extent because at the end of the day a Porsche is simply irresistible &amp; therefore becomes&nbsp;Hrithik&rsquo;s foremost pick for his daily commute.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>VI.

It is highly acclaimed worldwide for its tank-like build quality &amp; luxury that are meant to pamper the occupants in extreme comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking on any rough terrain is like a child&rsquo;s play for the big daddy due to the unfaltering <strong>Terrain Response System </strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does tend to look bland with a simple design language compared to rivals but when it comes to performance, the RR does not fail to impress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surely buying a vehicle of this cadre &amp; class will make you&nbsp;jaw dropped with its legendary status, prestige &amp; the&nbsp;tag of being used by powerful world leaders &amp; diplomats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hrithik owns this one too &amp; therefore it justifies his love &amp; craze for big &amp; brawny SUVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard work, dedication, relentless pursuit &amp; passion do pay off one day but people have to go through testing times to prove their caliber &amp; worth.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">Yes, you read that right, self-driving cars will become a reality in another <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\">5 years</strong>. Crazy as that sounds, it&rsquo;s not going to happen in Gurgaon, so you can rest easy and hold onto your horses. (wink)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A self-driving aka autonomous car essentially means a car that <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">doesn&rsquo;t need a driver</em> to go from point A to point B and that relies on software, additional hardware and Internet to drive them around. Leading car and tech companies are pumping in <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">billions of dollars </em>to make self-driving cars a reality. In fact, the competition is so fierce, it has woken up the most traditional car makers to jump the bandwagon and announced their own autonomous cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Key Players</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Who&rsquo;s who of tech and automotive industry are working furiously to come up with technology that will change <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">urban transportation</em> as we know it. Apple, Google, Uber, Nvidia, Tesla, GM, Ford, VW, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a> and lot many other companies are spending heavily on autonomous car R&amp;D. With so much of economic &amp; brain power being pumped into this technology, the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">day is not far</em> when driverless cars will become the norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who is racing ahead?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Tesla, Google, and Uber are clearly <strong>ahead on the learning curve</strong> than most of the other companies. Google&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/\">self-driving car</a> project started as early as 2009, at a time when most of the companies weren&rsquo;t even considering the technology as serious. In that sense, Google had a clear lead and its self-driving cars have clocked almost <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">2 million miles</em> in test runs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CqSDWoAhvLU\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Google has clearly lost the lead to Uber and Tesla. Both of these companies have clearly <strong>caught Google napping</strong> and are coming out with amazing feats to bolster their autonomous car leader claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/7-mind-boggling-facts-about-tesla-motors\">Tesla</a> already offers an autonomous feature called <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/autopilot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">autopilot</a> in all its in-production cars with hardware already installed on their cars. That&rsquo;s an enormous feat</em>, giving them ability to update software remotely and update self-driving capabilities of their cars. See Tesla Autopilot in action:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tP7VdxVY6UQ\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Uber is catching up with Tesla and coming up with its own technology for self-driving cars. It has put a lot of sensors on the top of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ford\">ford</a> fusions which are being tested in Michigan, Uber&rsquo;s test bed for its <strong>self-drive car</strong> initiative. Having driverless cars makes a lot of sense for Uber as it will allow them to completely automate its ride-hailing service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uber users in Pittsburgh are now part of a <a href=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/pittsburgh-self-driving-uber/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pilot program</a> where they will get to be part of the future and have a chance to ride around in a self-drive Uber car.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmofgf-Y3Mc\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>How the Future Does Looks?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Self-driving cars will become a reality in the next <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.in/These-20-companies-are-racing-to-build-self-driving-cars-in-the-next-5-years/articleshow/55926299.cms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">5 years</a>. Advanced countries like the U.S. are leading the charge and providing a healthy ecosystem to encourage the development of futuristic technology for autonomous cars. By 2017, Tesla plans to drive an autonomous car<em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\"> from LA to New York</em>. All major car companies Honda, Ford, Nissan, BMW, etc. will be coming out with self-driving cars by the early 2020&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The biggest hurdle for the future of self-driving cars is not the technology but regulations and government support. If governments and local bodies come together, then self-driving cars will become a reality faster. Just recently, Michigan State in U.S. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2016/12/09/michigan-self-driving-cars/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">passed a law</a> that will allow self-driving cars to<strong style=\"font-size:22px;\"> legally ply</strong> on public roads for testing and eventual sales as well after it passes regulatory requirements.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of self-driving cars is very promising and a lot of <strong>great minds</strong> of the world are racing to make it a reality. All we got to do is sit back, relax and let them <strong>self-drive</strong> this tech into our lives for real.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are a Xbox, PC or Playstation fanboy, there are some car video games that go beyond the platform and capture our minds forever. The love of speed, thrill of chase, adventure of completing a mission and the perverse satisfaction of destroying things just for the heck of it, all of these things make video games such a massive force to reckon with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t love driving their own<a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\"> Ferrari&rsquo;s</a>, creating their own empires and hanging out with the hottest babes.

Let us drive down into the alleys of gaming world and see the most sought after car based video games ever:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Need For Speed</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Undoubtedly the most famous car based video game ever, the Need For Speed series has been on every gamer&rsquo;s machine.

The premise of the NFS series has been simple; participate in a race, win races to score points and unlock cars and tracks. The first NFS title was created by a little know game studio called Distinctive Studio from Vancouver, Canada. From BMW to Acura, it has all the brands a car lover could ask for. NFS has captured <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/movies-that-killed-the-most-cars-in-the-history-of-hollywood\">hollywood</a>&rsquo;s attention as well, having been made into a mainstream movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FhCCBXhNr4\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - You Tube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gran Turismo</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Exclusively available on Playstation, Gran Turismo aka GT is a critically acclaimed series which boasts of a large number of original licensed vehicles. Since its debut in 1997, over 70 million copies of GT have been sold worldwide, establishing itself as a brand to reckon with.

And which is the better place to witness all this madness under a single roof than a car commercial. Many of us have been <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">spell-bound</em> by the grandiose sets and fierce supercars doing breath-taking stunts in an advertisement but are all these real? Of course not! It can&rsquo;t be, as most of the time real is not sexy enough, may not sound convincing, can be too expensive, involves risk or too difficult to shoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea behind any advertisement is to manipulate people&rsquo;s mind and develop a feeling of longing but in many cases, photographers play on both side of the lens.<em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\"> Felix Hernandez</em>, a photographer by profession, is the best example in this case. But before moving further, let&rsquo;s watch this popular <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/r8\">Audi R8</a> commercial that is doing rounds in the market:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZTUjYSsdvps\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - YouTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Chilling! Isn&rsquo;t it? And the manner in which Audi R8 made its way is simply spine-tingling. But do you know that many of these cars in such <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/9-car-ads-to-blow-your-mind\">commercials</a> are not a real but toy cars? Yes, recently, Audi hired Hernandez for a <em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">$160,000 worth supercar photoshoot</em> but it didn&rsquo;t provide any real car to the photographer for the shoot. Or it&rsquo;s better to say that Hernandez actually didn&rsquo;t need any. All he required was a detailed $40 toy car and some flour to do the magic!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"$160,000 worth supercar photoshoot\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/2.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - pop.h-cdn.co</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, some plaster of Paris to create the effect of waves:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Another miniature wonder by Hernandez is the LOVE CAR\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/5.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - pop.h-cdn.co</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">Another miniature wonder by Hernandez is the <strong>LOVE CAR</strong>.

In fact, the snow-covered pine trees, the handprint on one of the windows, the tyre impressions on the snow, the dust, the headlight and the mesmerizing background too aren&rsquo;t real. Check this out!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/htKI2zlCmwI\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - YouTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The best thing about Hernandez is that he never gives<em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\"> &lsquo;photoshop&rsquo;</em> effects to his pieces but uses props, miniature models,<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> in-camera effects</em> and lighting to give a realistic touch to each of his masterpiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of manipulation with viewer&rsquo;s mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tDvBwPzJ7dY\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - YouTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In this thrilling ad, the car used was real but not the surroundings. The<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> Italian beast with 700HP </em>is seen rampaged in and around the tough terrains and climatic conditions, but in reality, the situation is something very different and not unusual. Have a look at behind the scenes of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini/aventador\">Lamborghini Aventador</a> ad:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ni3gE0j29Zs\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - santaclausind</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you can pretty well imagine, it&rsquo;s not Lamborghini but the creative head of the videographer who gave the commercial a magnificent touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><em>Another example to be considered:</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"4\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/4.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - Coran Gleed Photography</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it remind you of the golden era &ndash; the old times? The <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">red Bentley looks stunning </em>with every finest detail minutely visible. One look is enough to take your heart away! Now let&rsquo;s reveal the truth behind this spectacular shoot. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bentley\">The Bentley</a> is basically a toy car and the garage is a cardboard box. Have a look:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"6\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/6.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - Coran Gleed Photography</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another commercial that has made it to the list is the 2016 Audi TT advertisement titled, &ldquo;Audi TT: Reality? Check.&rdquo; The ad has been shot using the<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> tilt-shift photography style</em> to provide a surreal effect to it. Where the boy is seen busy playing with its toy-sized <a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in/models/tt/tt_coupe.html\">Audi TT</a>, the real one is seen performing brilliantly well in a surreal and vivid environment. But the irony is &ndash; the Audi TT showed stunt-driving in<em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px\"> &lsquo;real world&rsquo;</em> is actually a toy car&nbsp;again, which if observed minutely, can be noticed.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Representing your country on an international platform in any domain or sporting event is a matter of great pride, prestige and honour and when the game happens to be cricket,<em> it can send the fans into frenzied excitement and they are just glued to their TV sets till the last ball</em>. Now legends are associated with every sporting activity and this game has had a rich history of producing some of the finest players of India, like Sachin Tendulkar,Rahul Dravid ,Anil Kumble and Saurav Ganguly, all who have won accolades for their performance worldwide. But records are meant to be broken and it is none other than <strong>Virat Kohli</strong> who has set bigger milestones in his career span. His sheer might and willpower to face the opponent in testing times has always proved fruitful and led India to victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s the success mantra?</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Run Machine Virat Kohli\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/2-Stylish_Look_of_Virat.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - hdnicewallpapers</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The never let go attitude, hard-work, focus and determination of this Delhi lad has contributed to his undisputed success in the game. The spectators are assured of a win-win situation based on his solo efforts. His quest for runs also extends to his choice of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sedan\">cars</a>, being an <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\">Audi</a> lover that he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we draw a parallel between him and the German car manufacturer, both represent class, elegance, innovation, advancement, quality and, off course, a huge fan following. By the way, these characteristics describe how Virat modifies his game every time according to the opponent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"German car manufacturer Audi\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/3-kohli-with-yellow-audi.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - hdpicswale</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.audi.in/sea/brand/in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Audi India&rsquo;s</a> marketing strategy primarily depends upon featuring <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/hrithik-roshan-greek-god-of-bollywood-his-exotic-car-collection\">Bollywood stars</a> and cricketing legends along with organizing events and showcasing the performance of their cars in movies that has really paid off because since the time they entered our country and set up base here, the other two German Rivals were well ahead in terms of sales, brand awareness and model acceptance but Audi has caught up swiftly and is the most preferred luxury brand in current times.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\">A racer pedigree at heart</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Indian Cricket Team\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/4-racer-pedigree-at-heart.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - ianshindi</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Audi has a large number of sports cars in its <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\">product portfolio in India</a> including the S5,R6 Avant ,RS7 Sportback and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/2011-used-audi-r8-spyder-detail\">R8</a> which have some tremendous amount of bhp and torque on tap that can readily burn the rubber with their instant acceleration. Audi arranges media drives of these supersonic beauties on the Buddh International Circuit along with getting the Bollywood actors and celebrities to endorse with Virat being the most popular and having driven most of these cars, making this luxury brand one of the obvious choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yi44GwEnzn0\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - YouTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Till now whatever you have read above describes a strong relationship between the well-known personalities and Audi. But have we told you that how many cars does Virat own from the Audi stable? Being a proud owner of the time tested <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/2014-used-audi-q7-detail\">Q7</a> he got his hands on the Audi R8 LMX , a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sports car</a> whose production is limited to 99 units worldwide and is priced at Rs 2.97 Crores .</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DoZ2Jp9yTs0\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - YouTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is simply the world&rsquo;s most fastest production supercar and here in India has set its own benchmark &amp; prestige keeping in mind a huge fan following. If we talk about the technical specifications of the car, it will simply leave you spellbound because this car has a naturally aspirated V10 high revving engine and if the sound from the exhausts remind you of a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> then don&rsquo;t be surprised. <em>The heart is a 5.2-litre petrol motor that gains additional 20bhp in comparison to the R8 Plus so as a result the 0-100Kmph timing is of 3.4 seconds and top speed is pegged at 320 km/hr</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the R8\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/5-maxresdefault.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - ytimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>So this reflects the sportiness along with passion &amp; enthusiasm to own and drive a supercar in town. Actually both being similar in nature, Virat is regarded as a run machine who breaks records in no time and so does the R8 which gathers pace at the blink of an eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>An epitome of safety &amp; luxury</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SR5OY0HtQU\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - YouTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming to his next prized possession, this product from the four-ringed German manufacturer is greatly admired by leaders, corporates, diplomats and VIPs worldwide. The reason is because it is positioned high up in Audi&rsquo;s Portfolio and is made available for only a select few and such is the aura and presence of this car that you are instantly reminded of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/movies-that-killed-the-most-cars-in-the-history-of-hollywood\">movie</a> Transporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An impression may have appeared in your mind and it is none other than the <em><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/used/audi/2014-used-audi-a8-l-detail\">Audi A8L</a> W12 6.3L Quattro with a mammoth 494bhp at 6200rpm and 625Nm at 4750rpm priced at over Rs. 2 Crores on road Delhi</em> .Literally a beast and powerhouse on beast with a tank like build quality meant to provide sheer comfort to the passengers and the best safety technology around. This had to be Virat&rsquo;s obvious choice because an image is portrayed in the fan&rsquo;s subconscious minds that the right-handed batsman stands and fights like a wall till the end. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/2012-used-audi-a8l-detail\">A8L</a> W12 Quattro proclaims to be one of the segment leader in safety, protection and performance and meeting expectations of the buyer every time a journey is undertaken.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"super exotic cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/6-super-cars-imports-india.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - team-bhp</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>So in the end, Virat Kohli&rsquo;s passion for cars and performance in Cricket is simply unbeatable and that is one of the prime reasons we have millions of people following the game diligently and in all forms. It is his sheer hard work, dedication and enthusiasm that has lifted him to such great heights and on reaching such a platform, he deserves being driven in <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">super exotic cars</a> like the R8 LMX and A8L W12 Quattro. Whether be it the magnificent strokes or the captaincy skills on field, Kohli truly shows that he is the master of the game. He is the boss!</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Among many other names in history, Pablo Escobar is one name that you simply cannot afford to not know. For those of you who haven&rsquo;t heard about him before, Pablo Escobar was the son of a humble farmer, who eventually rose to become one of the<a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/do-you-know-which-cars-the-richest-billionaires-on-earth-own-%E2%80%93-part-2\"> most powerful men</a> in the world by running the biggest cocaine businesses ever. In fact, he was listed by <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Forbes as one of the richest men in the world</em>, seven times in a row, starting from 1987, worth in his peak over 9 billion dollars. If you don&rsquo;t know how much that means, here&rsquo;s a little fact: The collective GDP of Iceland and Africa put together couldn&rsquo;t beat that amount!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"dimText\">It is no mystery the drug lord had massive wealth. And, by massive we mean, during the peak of his career, Escobar was losing more than <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\">2 Billion a year</strong> because of rats eating it away in the storage. Ever thought how it would feel like to have so much money that you can lose 2.1 billion dollars a year and not care? We cannot.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But did you know that besides being a drug lord, a merciless criminal, Pablo was also a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/this-is-what-happens-when-there-resides-a-traveler-inside-a-crazy-car-lover-%E2%80%93-ii\">car fanatic</a>? A life surrounded by multiple villas, women, cash, guns, and of course, cars. Let&rsquo;s find out about his fascination with cars:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Pablo owned almost everything you can think of&hellip; including a stunning collection of cars:</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"racing-hero-2\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/racing-hero-2.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - allautoexperts</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from owning a number of hover crafts, submarines and Private jets, he had a car collection to fall for. His choice in cars resonated a man who had risen from slums to be a drug lord whose wealth knew no bounds. He liked a <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">$500,000 Mercedes 300SL roadster</em> as much as he liked the classic Renault 4L. He was the proud owner of a Mercedes 300 SL, a Porsche 356, a Mercedes 600 limo, a dozen of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/toyota/land-cruiser\">Toyota Land cruisers</a> and several 20&rsquo;s &amp; 30&rsquo;s vintage American Phaetons. Oh, and not to forget a number of bikes! It&rsquo;s said that Escobar&rsquo;s choice was not ordinary (just like him!). He did not go for the usual Lambos or <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferraris</a> that probably every rich man would. Instead, he would <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">buy any supercar</a> that would strike his fancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Pablo, the Racing Hero?</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Pablo, the Racing Hero\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/2-the-Racing-Hero.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - blogspot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Before Pablo became the unbeatable drug lord, do you know what is it that he was famous for? What was it that made the press catch attention before he became filthy rich? Pablo was a competitor in the popular <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Copa Renault 4</a>. The &quot;Renault&quot; in Columbia, at the time almost as good as the national symbol and still remains to be so till date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">As his natural tendency to compete and lead was higher than anything else. So he decided to enter the <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\">Copa Renault 4 championship in Bogota</strong> and earned quite a lot of praise for his racing skills.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Before becoming the Drug Lord, Pablo Sold Stolen Cars:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Pablo started off very small, he always had big dreams. Call it the love for cars or anything else, but before Pablo Escobar got into the business of smuggling cocaine, he used to <em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">steal old cars </em>and re-sell their parts. He also sold fake lottery tickets and scammed people.

The sporty and sophisticated carbon fibre seats will perfectly complement the micro-suede accent of the cabin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2017 Bugatti Chiron ($2,600,000)</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bugatti Chiron\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bugatti-Chiron.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - caricos</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Touted to be the improvised version the powerful and one of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/meet-the-world-s-fastest-convertible-hennessey-venom-gt-spyder\">fastest supercars</a>, Bugatti Veyron, the 2017 Chiron is expected to hold more power with a majestic figure of 1480BHP.

From the inside, the car seems just perfect for those who derive pleasure and comfort from their ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keating Berus</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Keating Berus\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Keating-Berus.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - performancedrive</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bolton-based supercar maker is expected to launch its Berus this year, though there is no update on the launch date and pricing of this massive beast. It will be available in three options &ndash; one with naturally-aspirated engine, the other with twin-turbocharged version and the last one with electric motor. The gasoline one will churn out more than 650BHP of power whereas the one with twin-turbocharged is claimed to produce a <em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">whopping count of 2,000BHP</em>. The electric model will generate a decent amount of 400BHP. The top speed estimated is to be up to 340mph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So which one do you think is your cup of tea?

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could work on things which really excite us, things which make us get up in the middle of the night? We have wondered for a while, about what would be the best job for car lovers. Of Course, it would be perfect if we could be an F1 driver, driving the fastest cars on the planet, hogging all the limelight and making millions. Honestly, that will be the dream job for any car lover but F1 car racing is not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. It requires inhuman strength for all the <em style=\"font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">G-force F1 drivers</em> go through in each lap and a samurai like focus to keep at it, around the year, season after season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best job for normal car lovers is what Mr. Valentino Balboni did for forty years. Having trouble understanding who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Balboni\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">he is</a>? Well, he was the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">chief test driver of Lamborghini</em> till 2008, having served Lambo for a good 40 years. He started out in 1968 as a mechanic for Lamborghini and was asked by Lamborghini&rsquo;s owner Ferruccio Lamborghini to test drive the new cars coming out of the factory.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the chief test driver of Lamborghini\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/1-Jobs-in-the-Auto-industry.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - sevenroadsclub</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is said that Balboni has driven almost <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">80% of all Lamborghini</em> ever built. This is what we are talking about. A job which pays to test drive a Lambo and report problems in it. Pure car love can sustain a man in the such a job for forty years! He even has a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> with his name, a 2009 Gallardo line-up called the LP550-2 Valentino Balboni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Bob Wallace from New Zealand</em> is another person who did some amazing jobs in his heydays that would make any car lover jealous. Also attributed as the chief test driver for Lamborghini, he was known as the trouble shooter in the Lamborghini factory and even attended to duties such as road engineering. He contributed to three lightweight Lamborghini while he was there and was accustomed to impromptu races with Maserati and Ferrari drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bob Wallace from New Zealand\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/2-Jobs-in-the-Auto-industry.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cafespa</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most car lovers can only dream of driving a supercar and getting paid for it. Becoming a test driver for an F1 team is the best thing that can happen to a car lover. However, you can&rsquo;t just walk into <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari&rsquo;s</a> office and ask them to let you drive their million dollar beauties! The best way to find a <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">test driver job</em> is to first try to get a job with car manufacturers. That job can be a driver or a mechanic or some other oddball job that would keep you near to cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For noobs best place to start with would be normal <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">car manufacturers</em> and getting a job with them. This is the best way to start learning about how a car is manufactured from ground up. If you have passion and perseverance then you can find your way through to become a test driver for a great car company like BMW or Ferrari. It will be a slow journey but if you are sure-footed and determined then not an impossible journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you are a parent wanting your sons and daughters to go into the mesmerising <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/our-showroom\">world of supercars</a> then start them early. Get them to work with you in the garage, take them for <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">Go Karting</em> and share with them your passion for cars. Do a Dangal and make your dreams theirs and their targets your life goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Go Karting \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/3-Jobs-in-the-Auto-industry.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - adventuresetups</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to find how you can work in any of the prestigious car company like BMW, Ferrari etc. is to keep looking on job portals and company website for an opportunity. Sometimes you might get <a href=\"https://jobs.ferrari.com/cezannecv/RecruitmentWeb/CznWfResearch_FERRARI.asp?FUNID=7004517&amp;ACTION=INSERT&amp;RITORNO=INIZIO&amp;LANGID=1033&amp;DINAMICIMAGES=STD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">lucky</a>! Though a lot of these companies usually <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">hire local talent </em>or people who graduate from prestigious universities. Best hack for this is to study in a university near towns where these companies are located. Studying in Italy or Germany would be a good choice as a lot of sought after car makers have factories as well as main headquarters in these two countries.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s automobile world belongs to designers. Just give them the free reign to conceptualize and what you will get as an end product will be insanely breathtaking. Something akin to this has been witnessed recently at the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">CES 2017</em>. These creative heads have given their best shots to push the limits of what can be possible on a four-wheeled platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year it was BMW that stole the limelight with its <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/concept-cars-a-vision-into-future\">BMW Vision NEXT 100 concept car</a>, but this year it&rsquo;s not just one brand. With a bunch of ideas to bring into the world some of the most iconic machines and concepts, these brands have taken a sneak peek into the future of mobility. Let&rsquo;s check them out!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Faraday Future FF91</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"2-faraday-future\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/2-faraday-future.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - baltana</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This must be the biggest surprise for the car enthusiasts after they left any hope from the Faraday Future. Presenting the future of transportation in the near future, the Faraday FF91 has finally came out of the concept envelope and entered into the production phase. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/car-news/the-tesla-killer-has-finally-arrived-faraday-future-unveils-superfast-electric-car-ff91\">Expected to be delivered from 2018</a>, this concept car has imposed a <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">big challenge to the <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\">Tesla Model S</strong></em> in the electric cars category.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Toyota Concept-i</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"3-toyota-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/3-toyota-concept.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - designboom</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>One look at its stunning beauty and you will fall in love with it! The Concept-i is all about artificial intelligence and how smartly the machine could connect with its driver. Taking the interaction to a completely different level, the machine will be able to <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">decipher the mood of the driver</em> and connecting with him/her accordingly. Want to have a look? Here it is:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEpZxE9E-6U\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It sound like K.I.I.T. but Toyota prefers to call it <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&lsquo;Yui&rsquo;</em>. In general terms, the Toyota Concept-i will introduce a helpful friend in your life. And yes, it will be <em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">voice controlled</em>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nissan BladeGlider with Nissan Intelligent Mobility</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"4-Nissan-blade-Glider\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/nissan-4-blade-glider.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - autoguide</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the alarming environmental issues, Nissan chooses to go for an electric vehicle this time in the form of Nissan BladeGlider &ndash; <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">a high performance sportscar concept with zero emission</em>. The eye-catching feature of the car was its gullwing doors that open vertically and perfectly compliment the aerodynamic design of the vehicle. Here watch the video:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLlbGSOogUQ\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Climate change, road fatalities, traffic congestions and the increasing pollution in air are things that are the reason of worry for automakers too and this is why Nissan has introduced an Intelligent Mobility concept to fight against all such major causes. Thus, zero fatalities and zero emission has become the ultimate goal of Nissan&rsquo;s future vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BMW HoloActive Touch Concept</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"5-bmw-holoactive-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/5-bmw-holoactive-concept.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - assets</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Experience always speaks and makes you stand out of the crowd of commoners. On the same line BMW is moving with its 100+ years of existence. If you think touchscreen and voice control are the latest trends in technology, you need to reconsider your choice. BMW unveiled a totally new HoloActive Touch Concept at the electronics show, CES 2017. This concept will use <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">holograms to interact</em> with the driver to convey information. Here is a short glimpse:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1B-7uQ5RD2A\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youTube</span>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">According to the Bavarian carmaker, this technology is a step ahead of the Air Touch System introduced in the BMW i Vision Future Interaction concept car showcased last year.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Honda NeuV</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"6-honda-neuv-concept\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/6-honda-neuv-concept.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cbsistatic</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The new electric urban vehicle by Honda revolves more around a ridesharing car than a traditional one. The company has introduced <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">&lsquo;emotional engine&rsquo;</em> with this concept vehicle that is completely based on artificial intelligence. The vehicle offers an insight into how the future of transport industry will be with change in the car ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Honda Self Balancing Motorcycle</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"7-honda-con-bike\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/7-honda-con-bike.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - assets</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think that experiments are possible only on a 4-wheeled platform, you need to re-consider your thought. The Self Balancing Motorcycle concept by Honda is enough to give a setback to all those myths. Much easier to ride than other two-wheelers, this Self Balancing Motorcycle takes the<em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\"> help of the gyroscope</em> to keep the bike moving in the right direction without losing the balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chrysler Portal</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"8-chrysler-portal\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/8-chrysler-concept.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - assets.wired</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>You may find a minivan to be too boring in terms of design but the new Chrysler Portal concept will change your perception. The slick new design along with autonomous driving feature makes a long way for this concept vehicle. This <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">fully electric minivan</em> is meant for millennials. What&rsquo;s more interesting is the fact that you can customize it according to your seating preference.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LeEco LeSee Pro</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"9-Leco-LeSee-Pro\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/9-Leco-LeSee-Pro.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - i3.letvimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another car to pose challenge to the Faraday Future&rsquo;s FF91 is LeEco LeSee Pro, which is a low cost model and is by the company who has invested in Faraday. The new concept vehicle can be termed as an update to the original LeSee showcased last year in China. According to the company, the car has been <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">designed keeping in mind &ndash; entertainment</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes Vision Van</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"10-mercedes-vision-van\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/10-mercedes-vision-van.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - netcarshow</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s experience that speaks and Mercedes has mastered in it. Where other car makers are struggling to bring out their best through their concept vehicles, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, on the other hand, does what it feels right. The images might not allure you but like we said, it&rsquo;s Mercedes. The Vision Van has automated racks inside that are <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">designed for the drivers delivering packages</em>. The icing on the cake is the two drones that will be delivering packages weighing up to 4 pounds at your doorstep within a radius of 6 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes AMG Hypercar</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"11-mercedes-AMG-hypercar\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/11-mercedes-AMG-hypercar.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -blogspot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The German luxury carmaker also teased its upcoming hypercar with AMG platform. This concept car marks the 50th anniversary of AMG. The car is in the production phase and will be <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">showcased at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show</em>. It is expected to have a 1.6-litre V6 Turbo engine, which is in the same line of Hybrid Power Unit of F1 racecar. The engine claims to churn a maximum power of 986bhp.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hyundai Mobility Vision Concept</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"12-Hyundai_Mobility_Vision\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/12-Hyundai_Mobility_Vision.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -cdn1.vox</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The best concept so far, we must say! Hyundai has introduced a concept that will integrate the future Hyundai cars with homes. Based on the notion &ndash; home is where the car is &ndash; the company has introduced a concept wherein the car can be an extension of your house. The Mobility Vision Concept has smartly <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">dropped the separating wall between the car and the home</em>. It will be interesting to see how this concept will take the shape of reality without affecting the menacing traffic.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- End 404 Area --></div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<h2>Which Super car would your favourite Game Of Thrones character drive?</h2>\r\n<p>Our collective jaws are on floor as we just cannot wait to find out what Game of Thrones Season 7 has in store for us. While the last season revealed some answers about Jon Snow&rsquo;s parents, there are still more questions waiting to be answered. Not that we are not extremely fascinated by the beautiful horses, we thought it would be fun to imagine if Westeros had proper road networks, which super cars would all our favourite characters drive?</p>\r\n<h2>1. Cersei Lannister: Mercedes 600 Pullman</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Cersei-Lannister-Mercedes-600-Pullman\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Cersei-Lannister-Mercedes-600-Pullman.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>The car as we know is an all time &ldquo;dictator&rsquo;s&rdquo; favourite, there is nobody who&rsquo;d carry of this <a href=\"/sports\">Supercar</a> as well as Cersei Lannister would. Only a supercar like the <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Mercedes 600 Pullman</em> would do justice to a character like Cersei's, somebody who can be painfully merciless while being the most passionate lover one can find.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Joffrey Lannister: A Golden Lambo Aventador</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Joffrey Lannister: A Golden Lambo Aventador\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Joffrey-Lannister.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>While we have all openly hated Joffrey&rsquo;s character and the feeling when Joffrey died cannot and will not match up to anything else. We can all agree that Joffrey as a character was always bit of a show off and only a Golden <a href=\"/lamborghini/aventador\">Lamborghini Aventador</a> would go with his personality, both of them <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">flashier than the other!</em></p>\r\n<h2>3. Arya Stark: A mini cooper &lsquo;Convertible</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Arya-Stark-A-mini-cooper-&acirc;&euro;&tilde;Convertible\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/arya-stark-mini-cooper-convertible.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>All good things come in small packages. Don&rsquo;t let her size deceive you! Arya Stark might have small stature, but she is as fierce and as lethal as anyone else. Killing anyone who comes her way with her &ldquo;needle&rdquo;! <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The MINI Cooper is just as small and ferocious as Arya is</em>.</p>\r\n<h2>4. Tyrion Lannister: Chrysler 300</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Tyrion-Lannister-Chrysler-300 \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Tyrion-Lannister-Chrysler-300.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>A favourite of many, Tyrion however remains to be the unsung hero. What he lacks in strength, he makes up in his intelligence and wit. That is why we have chosen the <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Chrysler 300 for Tyrion</em>. Classy and intelligent, however both seem to be the underdogs!</p>\r\n<h2>5. Daenerys Targaryen: Range Rover Sport SE</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Daenerys-Targaryen-Range-Rover-SE\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Daenerys-Targaryen-Range-Rover-SE.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>Now we just cannot imagine the <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Mother of the Dragons</em> moving around in a car that cannot handle her dragons, can we? A <a href=\"/used/land-rover/2017-used-range-rover-sports-se-detail\"><em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\">Range Rover </em></a><em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\"><a href=\"/used/land-rover/2017-used-range-rover-sports-se-detail\">Sport</a></em><a href=\"/used/land-rover/2017-used-range-rover-sports-se-detail\"><em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\"> SE</em></a> is solid enough to resist any kind of attacks and has ample space for her and her dragons to chill.</p>\r\n<h2>6. Sansa Stark: Rolls Royce Phantom IV</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Sansa-Stark-Rolls-Royce-Phantom\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Sansa-Stark-Rolls-Royce-Phantom.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>When we see Sansa on screen, we are just awestruck by her beauty and royalty. Only a car as exclusive and royal as the <a href=\"/rolls-royce/phantom\">Rolls Royce Phantom</a> IV (<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the most exclusive Rolls Royce model ever built) would do justice to her character</em>!</p>\r\n<h2>7. Jon Snow: Suzuki Vitara</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jon-Snow-Suzuki-Vitara\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Jon-Snow-Suzuki-Vitara.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n<p>Being in the night&rsquo;s watch- naturally, Jon Snow would not have a huge budget to buy a fancy luxury car. But he also understands, that he needs to face a lot of difficult times including the winters, so he&rsquo;d go for a <a href=\"http://www.marutisuzuki.com/grand-vitara.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Suzuki Vitara</a>!</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Did we miss any of your favourite characters?

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Bollywood is obsessed with super luxury cars. It&#39;s the industry where dreams are made and shattered every Friday. Even though the khan trio rules the roost, Bollywood actresses are in high demand and have a massive following across the world. In this male dominated industry, the female actresses are giving the lead actors a <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">run for their money</em> when it comes to owning <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/uber-rich-supercars-making-their-debut-in-2017\">uber cool cars</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current crop of actresses are serious about which cars they own and drive in. So much so that top Bollywood divas have cars worth crores sitting in their garage. Their cars are worth more than what <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">normal folks would earn in their lifetime</em>. With their own hotness as an icing on the cake, these Bollywood starlets with their mean machines is a delight to spectate. Without further delay, let&#39;s find out which cars do our favorite actresses own.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Priyanka Chopra</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>More fondly known as Piggy Chops, Priyanka Chopra is a top Bollywood actress. She has done some amazing work in Bollywood and is now an established international actor with a full blown TV series Quantico and acting credits in mainstream Hollywood movie Baywatch. With so much fame and money comes the right car. Priyanka likes to roll in the hottest cars and her collection includes a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/rolls-royce/ghost\">Rolls-Royce Ghost</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw/7-series\">BMW 7 Series</a>, Porsche Cayenne and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/e-class\">Mercedes E-Class</a>. Total cost of these cars is more than <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">10 crores</em>, an amount of money most people will not earn in their lifetime. She even owns a <em style=\"font-weight:bold;color:pink;\">pink color Harley Davidson</em> for that rugged bikers day out.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Priyanka Chopra Cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Priyanka-Chopra.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alia Bhatt</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The chirpy and effervescent Alia Bhatt is favorite of young and old alike. Having done some really meaty roles in the recent past and a lot of brand endorsements, Alia Bhatt surely has the money to splurge on mean machines. Daughter of Bollywood legend Mahesh Bhatt, she packs a punch when it comes to her choice of cars. Alia seems to have a <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">liking for Audi </em>and owns two beautiful Audi cars. She cruises around Mumbai in <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/q5\">Audi Q5</a> and A6, having a well-balanced garage. Alia&rsquo;s collection is perfect to go for a long drive or, of course, to an award function.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Alia Bhatt's Audi Q5\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Alia-Bhatt.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Shilpa Shetty</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This leggy lass has charmed us during the 90&rsquo;s, having worked with all top actors in Bollywood in the past two decades. Even though Shilpa is not seen in any new movies lately, she still has a car collection that will make you green with envy. She is a co-owner of an IPL team and is as rich as they come! When it comes to cars, <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Shilpa Shetty likes supercars</em> and owns a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini/gallardo\">Lamborghini Gallardo</a> and BMW i8. Yes, she is driven around Mumbai in the meanest cars on the planet! It&rsquo;s alleged that these cars are a gift from her billionaire husband, but even then a lot of ladies out there wouldn&rsquo;t go for such an extreme and bindass car choice. We are now bigger fans of Shilpa after knowing her badass car choice!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Shilpa-Shetty owns a Lamborghini \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Shilpa-Shetty.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - google</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Kangana Ranaut</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The queen bee, Kangana is the winner of 3 national film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangana_Ranaut,_roles_and_awards\" rel=\"no-follow\" target=\"_blank\">awards</a> and has completely transformed into one of the top actresses of the country.

Though not doing as many movies as she was doing a few years ago, Bipasha still kicks ass, when it comes to deciding cars for herself. She is a car lover and <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">owns an envious collection of cars</em>. Bipasha drives around in a Volkswagen Beetle, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi/q7\">Audi Q7</a>, Mercedes S-Class and Porsche Cayenne.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Do you know the most dangerous thing that you can do in your life? Play it SAFE! If you haven&rsquo;t surprised your life with something exciting and daring, we are sorry to say, you are not living it up to the brim. Don&rsquo;t believe us? Well, even the famous psychotherapist, <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Alfred W. Adler</em> is also of the same opinion:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;The chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the well-known American poet, Robert Frost, too concurs with Dr. Alfred on this point. He once quoted:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\" float:none; text-align:center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I &ndash;<br />\r\nI took the one less travelled by,<br />\r\nAnd that has made all the difference&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping all the philosophy aside, what we all want to say is that exploring new roads or better to say the roads less taken are dangerous yet exciting and thrilling. Plus it will add a memorable story that you will remember for the lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without taking much of your time, we have listed down few of the most dangerous roads in India where no or almost negligible air transport facility is available. These are the roads that witness the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">wrath of nature</em> very often, thus creating trouble for the explorers. But this hasn&rsquo;t dropped down their zeal to conquer these tough terrains, which is quite appreciable. For safety, it&rsquo;s better you start your journey in a true off-roader <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUV</a>. So let&rsquo;s explore these <em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\">&ldquo;Highways to Hell&rdquo;:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Zojila Pass</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Zojila Pass\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Zojila-Pass.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - projectsmonitor</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Situated at an altitude of more than <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">11,000 feet above the sea level </em> on Srinagar-Leh highway, Zojila Pass has been declared as the most dangerous mountain pass in India due to its narrow road which becomes impassable during rains or storms. This area also witnesses landslides frequently that further increase the risk of travelling on this route. Watch this video:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6uZVJXBAQs\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The video must have sent a chill down your spines but at the same time, the scenic beauty must have invited you to visit it once. Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Kinnaur Road</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Kinnaur-Road\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Kinnaur-Road.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - gettingnowhere</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>As the name suggests, this dangerous road is located in Himachal Pradesh&rsquo;s Kinnaur district. Traveling on this road is equivalent to having a ride on a dangerous giant wheel at an amusement park, but here the difference lies in the availability of the safety equipment. The <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">cliff-hanging drive </em>through the narrow and shady underpasses makes the travel all the more thrilling and full of surprises. This road has literally been carved out of the mountains and the sharp blind turns it has often resulted into accidents. Have a look:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/spW4tU1OEzQ\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Still in shock? The topsy-turvy road gives no chance for a re-take. One mistake and you will splash directly into the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">river Baspa flowing right below</em>. It is also known as Shimla-Kaza highway.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>National Highway 22</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"National-Highway-22 \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/National-Highway-22.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - quirkywanderer</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The name may form a very different image in your mind like that of the regular highways with broad road and sky-rocketing speed but believe us those who have actually traveled through this highway have a completely different opinion. For them, <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&ldquo;Highway to Hell&rdquo;</em> seems the right name. Dangerous cliffs, poor bridge, pitiable maintenance and huge traffic make this road one of the deadliest highways of the world. Take a view:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DR4yfN4_ew\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>If you remember, this is the same highway that was telecasted in <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&ldquo;IRT Deadliest Roads&rdquo; TV series by History Channel </em>for its hazardous road condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Khardung La Pass</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Khardung-La\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Khardung-La.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -travdiary</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to extreme weather conditions, this pass remains closed from October to May every year. This area is under army&rsquo;s strict inspection because it is located in Ladakh, a part of Jammu and Kashmir region. The BRO (Border Road Organization), staffed with Indian Army, has worked a lot to make it travelable but you cannot deny the deadliness it holds. It is more popular for its<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">hairpin turns</em> that make the journey full of challenges. Here&rsquo;s the video:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mF37SiFikQ\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Chilling, isn&rsquo;t it? Located at a <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">height of 18,380 feet</em>, this road has been declared as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khardung_La#The_world.27s_highest_motorable_claim\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">world&rsquo;s highest motorable road</a> and it claims to have its name listed in the Guinness Book of World Records. In fact, our very favorite <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> has successfully made its way to Khardung La pass. It falls on the Leh-Manali Highway.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Leh-Manali Highway</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Leh-Manali-Highway\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Leh-Manali-Highway.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -indivistas</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember the song, <em>&ldquo;Yeh Ishq Haye Bethe Bithaye <strong>JANNAT</strong> Dikhaye Haye&rdquo;</em>, from the movie, <em>Jab We Met?</em> If you still didn&rsquo;t get what we mean by quoting this song, here it is &ndash; this is the same beautiful location where this song was shot. We don&rsquo;t know whether our <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/a-sneak-peak-into-the-garages-of-our-bollywood-divas\">Bollywood diva</a>,<em> Kareena Kapoor</em>, now Kareena Kapoor Khan, was mesmerized by the scenic beauty of the surrounding or something else but we have fallen in love with the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Mother Nature&rsquo;s selection of beauty</em>. Take a glance:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kyOYIiv5v0s\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen heaven but we bet it can&rsquo;t be more beautiful than this one. Do you agree?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Nathula Pass</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Nathu-La\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Nathu-La.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -myeverydaylife</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Located in eastern Sikkim, this mountain pass is 14,140 feet high and gives competition to the Khardungla Pass. This pass serves as the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">major link between India and China for trade</em> and is also the oldest trading border post that is also the connecting link between Tibet and India. The word Nathu means &ldquo;Listening ears&rdquo; and the word La means &ldquo;pass&rdquo;. Take a dose:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G4-IqQjd-Io\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>For visiting this place you have to take a permit from Gangtok. Heavy snowfall on the route makes it less travelable and tricky many-a-times. Even the turns are dangerous so you have to be careful at each step.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sach Pass</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Sach-Pass\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Sach-Pass.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -blogspot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Not many people are aware of this road but it is also one of the trickiest roads in India that can give you an adrenaline rush. Located in Himachal Pradesh at an <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">altitude of 14,500 feet</em>, this mountain pass is all covered with snow that makes the travel more difficult and full of danger. This pass is the connection between the Chamba valley and Pangi valleys of HP. The narrow and unmetalled road adds more to the risk.<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">This road is majorly used by Indian Army</em>. The video will speak the rest:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUjOF0fmIW4\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -youTube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Sach Pass makes the smallest route to Killar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We know you have many other names in mind that you think could have been ranked in the above list. In that case, share your opinion in the comments section below so that the other readers can have enough options to decide their journey full of <strong>amusements and thrills</strong>.</em></p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Another fact that we can&rsquo;t deny is our fascination for speed and thrill. Oh no, here by &lsquo;we&rsquo; we mean car junkies! And for us, nothing can be a better entertainer than a movie with cars all around. And&hellip; if a movie has cars, it&rsquo;s obvious to expect some nerve chilling stunt scenes. Of course, it&rsquo;s not unfair to demand!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now, you must have collected the memories of some of the best movie cars you may have witnessed. But remember, the best stunts in movies are not only about the cinematic effects, the graphics or explosions that they employ, it&rsquo;s the swag of the driver that equally counts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. The Man With The Golden Gun</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to take this&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;I sure am boy&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Come on! Who would ever forget that freaking 360 degree spiral car jump? <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/cars-bond-cars\">James Bond</a> is quite popular for his association with some of the top-notch supercars in his movies and <em>&ldquo;The Man With The Golden Gun&rdquo;</em> probably occupies the numero-uno position in the entire franchise of 007. Enjoy the clip!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzCIbhLUUA0\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -Youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Didn&rsquo;t the<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> red AMC Hornet </em>make you drop your jaws with its perfect landing after doing a 360-degree circle in the air?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking about car stunts and not mentioning the unforgettable spiral drift of the Nissan 350Z would be an irredeemable mistake. How beautifully does the Nissan rip up a spiral-shaped parking garage passage, performed by the<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> professional drift driver, Rhys Millen!</em> The scene is simply a treat to the eyes where the tail of the 350Z was always an inch away from the wall of the concrete ramp. Here&rsquo;s the majestic glimpse:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3MAmVpAbEo\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source -Youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the complete <em>&lsquo;The Fast and the Furious&rsquo;</em> franchise is full of car actions, the above one needs special mention purely because of ultimate driving skills involved in the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3.The Blues Brothers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Blues Brothers must have been the all time favorite for many of us, not only for the wittiness and escaping power of the Blues Brothers&rsquo; but also because of the car stunts and crashes involved. Though there are many stunts in both the parts, the original movie of 1980 needs a special mention.

Claiming many firsts in the automotive industry, Mercedes-Benz has now been more than <em style=\" font-size:22px; font-weight:bold;\">130 years of age</em> and is like an old wine &ndash; the older the better. And like it is said &ndash; every legend has a history of its own &ndash; so do Mercedes-Benz. The biography of the marque has many facts that most of us might be unaware of. So let&rsquo;s take a dig at some of the unheard truths about Mercedes-Benz that may force you to respect the player all the more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>First Gas-powered Car</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"gas-powered-car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/gas-powered-car.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -automotorblog</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The year was 1886 when Karl Benz unveiled the first gasoline-powered car under the Benz-Patent Motorwagen (being the first car to receive a patent). Unlike the cars we see today, it was a three-wheeled vehicle made by using wooden panels, steel tube frame and a small gas-powered motor. The <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">engine churned out mere 2/3HP</em>, which is much lesser than the power of a real horse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>First Diesel Engine Passenger Car</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"First Diesel Engine Passenger Car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/diesel-engine-passenger-car.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -emercedesbenz</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in 1936, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a> created another milestone by introducing the 260D &ndash; the first diesel engine passenger car. Coded as Mercedes-Benz W 138, this first diesel motor vehicle was first showcased at the <em><strong>Berlin Motor Show in February 1936</strong></em>. It is presumed that the cost of 260D at that time was somewhere around the current cost of Mercedes-Benz <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/mercedes-benz/e-class\">E-Class</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1 Mercedes-Benz 500E = 18 Days</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz 500E\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/mercedes-benz-500e.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -wikipedia</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We all would agree that there exists a difference between a handmade thing and a machine-made one. Though many of us would prefer a machine assembled car over a handmade one, one cannot deny the perfection and finish in the latter one. This is why, each of the Mercedes-Benz 500E ever came into existence from 1990 to 1994 was hand built and it <em><strong>took almost 18 days</strong></em> to complete each model. Do you know who used to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_500_E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">hand built the 500E</a>? <em style=\" font-size:22px;\"><strong>PORSCHE!</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes-Benz Prefers Welding Over Bolts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Perfection has always been the motto of Mercedes-Benz and probably this is the reason why the marque uses lesser amount of nuts and bolts for each of its vehicle. According to the Stuttgart factory centre, the complete body of Mercedes-Benz is <em style=\" font-size:22px;\"><strong>welded in 10,000 places</strong></em>, which means minimal usage of bolts and reduced chances of wear and tear on the car. It is believed that this step would increase the road life of the vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expert Physicians Help in Designing Mercedes-Benz&rsquo;s Seats</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benzâ€™s Seats\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Mercedes-Benz-seats.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -Allday</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Like its body, even the seats of Mercedes-Benz are designed uniquely. To give utmost comfort to the passenger and the driver, the seats of Mercedes-Benz cars are designed with the help of orthopedic physicians so as to take care of the <em><strong>back, kidney and knee-joints areas</strong></em>. This makes the vehicle comfortable even for those who have health issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5861 Parts Means Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We all are well aware about the fact that the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercar</a> has Gullwing doors hinged on the roof. And you will be surprised to know that Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG is made up of 5,861 parts. But what is more fascinating is the fact that out of these parts, two are explosive capsules that help in <em><strong>bombing out the side doors</strong></em> in case the vehicle flips, so that the passengers can exit from the vehicle safely.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Intense Paint Job</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Intense Paint Job\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/intense-paint-job.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -gtagaming</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the Mercedes-Benz models is first drowned in a <em><strong>52 ton primer</strong></em> followed by four coats.

Taking the legacy forward, she along with her two sons &ndash; Richard and Eugen &ndash; went out in the first gasoline powered car from Mannheim to Pforzheim. This was known to be the first road trip of the world. The above image is of <em><strong>Bertha and Karl roaming in the 1984 Benz Victoria Model</strong></em>, which is the follow-up vehicle of the Patent Wagon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History Behind the Name</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of us are unaware about the truth behind the name Mercedes-Benz. Earlier known as Daimler-Benz, the company changed its name to Mercedes-Benz, where Mercedes was the name of a <em style=\" font-size:22px;\"><strong>racing driver&rsquo;s daughter</strong></em>. Yes, it&rsquo;s true (as the sources say)! The racing driver was also a renowned businessman in the late 1800s and was a loyal customer of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft &ndash; the company that merged with Benz &amp; Co.Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik to give birth to Daimler-Benz.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes-Benz Made Bicycles</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz Made Bicycles\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/benz-made-bicycles.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - motortrend</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>To cope up with the World War I impact on the economy, the Stuttgart-based carmaker decided to diversify the business. The Mercedes-Benz bicycle came in 1993 was the <em><strong>outcome of the diversification</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercedes-Benz Race Cars were Paintless</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz Race Cars were Paintless\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Benz-Race-Cars.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - mercedes-benz</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything with what we had seen in the Italian racecars happened before 1960s, where it was necessary for every Italian car to be red. The reason behind it was something different and quite interesting too. When Mercedes-Benz W25 racecar participated in the 1934 N&uuml;rburgring, the engineers found out that the weight of the car was 1kg extra than the required one. To meet the regulations, the <em><strong>company scraped off the white paint</strong></em>. Call it the magic or luck or science, the car won its first race by setting a new track record.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Adolf Hitler was Fond of Mercedes-Benz</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Adolf Hitler was Fond of Mercedes-Benz\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Hitler-Mercedes-Benz.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - ibtimes</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be shocked to know that the newly appointed Chancellor or that time, the very infamous Adolf Hitler, and his Nazi Party <em><strong>funded the entire program of W25 racecars</strong></em>. The idea behind it was to display the technological prowess of the German carmakers. Keeping this fact aside, sources also claim that Adolf Hitler himself was an ardent fan of Mercedes-Benz road cars. He used <em class=\"redText\" style=\"font-size:22px;\">Mercedes-Benz 770 as his official transport</em>&nbsp; that had a bulletproof windshield.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>World&rsquo;s First Self-driving Car in 80s</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Worldâ€™s First Self-driving Car in 80s\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/benz-s-class1995.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - criader</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Autonomous cars might came into limelight off-late with many carmakers trying their luck in the field, the one of the oldest marques, Mercedes-Benz, started working on the project almost 25 years ago. With the fund of <em><strong>&euro;800 million from European Union</strong></em>, Mercedes-Benz came out with an autonomous S-Class that covered a journey from Munich, Germany to Copenhagen, Denmark itself in the year 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Self-driving Truck</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, Mercedes-Benz has recently introduced an autonomous <em style=\" font-size:22px;\"><strong>Future Truck 2025</strong></em>, using the same technology it had used in the year 1995 in the self-driving S-Class.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center; color:#ff0000;\">What&#39;s a superhero really without his super powers? Nothing!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All superheroes are usually shown fighting off bad guys using exceptional super powers. Oh, stunts and action scenes are just unforgettable! Only if we could have the same powers, but then again, that is what sets them apart from us. Right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we imagined how exciting it would be if our superheroes got themselves <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\" target=\"_blank\">supercars;</a> cars that matched their personalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SUPERMAN: A BUGATTI CHIRON</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"superman-a-bugatti-chiron\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/superman-a-bugatti-chiron.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are somebody who can reverse time simply by flying around- it can only be the gorgeous <a href=\"http://www.bugatti.com/chiron/\" target=\"_blank\">Bugatti Chiron</a> can do justice. Although we know that Superman prefers flying than being on the roads, there are times that even he would need to take a ride and nothing better than the <em><strong>Chiron to go with his personality!</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WONDER WOMAN: LAMBORGHINI HURACAN</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"wonder-woman-lamborghini-huracan\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/wonder-woman-lamborghini-huracan.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We can&#39;t think of anything other than the Lamborghini Huracan that matches with the <em><strong>ferocious yet stylish personality</strong></em> of Wonder Woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SPIDER MAN: FERRARI 488 SPIDER</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"spiderman-ferrari-488-spider\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/spiderman-ferrari-488-spider.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, obviously! Even though Spider man&#39;s first choice would be swinging around the city. Who wants to get caught in the traffic after all? But for those times when our Spider Man wants to take his <em><strong>girlfriend out on a date</strong></em> - there would be nothing better than Ferrari 488 Spider!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CATWOMAN: PORSCHE PANAMERA TURBO&#39;S</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"catwoman-porsche-panamera-turbos\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/catwoman-porsche-panamera-turbos.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Sexy, sneaky, swift and sleek</strong></em> - these are the things that define the Catwoman. And, our vehicle of choice, the Porsche Panamera has the EXACT same traits. The match just seems like it&#39;s made in heaven. Catwoman or the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche/panamera\" target=\"_blank\">Porsche Panamera</a>, who&#39;s sexier? We can&#39;t figure!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BATMAN: ASTON MARTIN VULCAN</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"batman-aston-martin-vulcan\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/batman-aston-martin-vulcan.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We know you&#39;re thinking that no vehicle can be better for our Batman than the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/evolution-of-the-batmobile\" target=\"_blank\">Batmobile</a> itself. But when Batman needs to <em><strong>slip away through the streets of Gotham</strong></em> - Aston Martin Vulcan&#39;s flexibility and speed will come in handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>IRONMAN: LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"ironman-lamborghini-aventador\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ironman-lamborghini-aventador.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Sharp, sexy, and just impossible to ignore;</strong></em> we can&#39;t just stop thinking when Iron Man drives the car, would the eyeballs be on him or the car?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did we miss out on your favourite Superhero.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>For the 1990 kids, it was a golden era where right from the movies to albums, songs and fashion, everything was just prolific. In fact, this is the time when the automobile industry witnessed an upswing of cars that were not only the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><strong style=\" font-size:22px;\">&quot;CARS&quot;</strong> but <strong style=\" font-size:22px;\">&quot;SUPERCARS&quot;</strong></em>. <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">Ferrari</a>, Lamborghini, Bugatti and many more such names now hover over our mind when we talk about supercars but we had something in platter that may let you skip a beat. We have gathered few of the supercars from the 90s that we almost forgot. So, without much ado, let&#39;s start the countdown:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jaguar XJ220</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jaguar-XJ220\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Jaguar-XJ220.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - blogspot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Claimed to be the fastest production car of that era for a brief period of 1994-98, Jaguar XJ220 came into the market in 1992. Soon McLaren F1 overtook the title from the Jag XJ220; the latter somehow managed to maintain the record of <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">Nurburgring track with a lap time of 7:46.37</em> minutes till the year 2000. Throwing a speed of 213mph, the XJ220 was powered by a twin-turbo V6 3.5-litre engine and was <a href=\"http://newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2012/01/marking-20-years-launch-jaguar-xj220\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">designed</a> to churn out a power of 550PS with 475lbs-ft of torque, which enabled the beast to cover the mark of 0-100Kmph in less than 4 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Panoz Esperante GTR-1</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Panoz-Esperante-GTR-1\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Panoz-Esperante-GTR-1.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - panoz</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Like its name, Panoz Esperante GTR-1 had an unusual appearance and the company only <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">designed two of such road-legal race cars</em> to homologate for racing in 1997. It participated in IMSA GT, United States Road Racing Championship, American Le Mans Series, FIA GT Championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>TVR Cerbera Speed 12</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"TVR-Cerbera-Speed-12\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/TVR-Cerbera-Speed-12.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cdn2.3dtuning</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Owing to the fast speed it was born with, TVR Cerbera Speed 12 wasn&#39;t deemed fit for roads, hence only one prototype was made. Also known as Project 7/12, this high speed concept car is touted to be blessed with a <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">7.7-litre V12 engine producing around 800BHP of power</em> and was first showcased at the Birmingham Motor Show of 1996.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Aston Martin V8 Vantage Le Mans</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aston-Martin-V8-Vantage-Le-Mans\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Aston-Martin-V8-Vantage-Le-Mans.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - icdn-3.motor1</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The brand reminds us of its iconic history with <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/cars-bond-cars\">James Bond series</a> but do we still remember the special edition designed by this marque as an honor to its V8 Vantage for winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959? Commemorating the 40th anniversary of this memorable win, the company introduced <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">V8 Vantage Le Mans in 1999 in Geneva</em> &ndash; the only AM to bear the &quot;Le Mans&quot; moniker. It was powered by both 500BHP and V600 600BHP twin-turbocharged V8 motor mated to a <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">ZF 6-speed (5-speed modified) manual gearbox</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jaguar XJR-15</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jaguar-XJR-15\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Jaguar-XJR-15.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - supercars</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">If you think Jaguar XJ220 was the only supercar produced by the British marque during 1990s, you need to think again. Celebrating the success of XJR-9 Group C race car in the Le Mans, the company came up with XJR-15, which was loaded with a <strong>V12 6.0-litre engine producing 450BHP of power</strong>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dauer 962 Le Mans</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Dauer-962-Le-Mans\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Dauer-962-Le-Mans.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - supercars</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Though Porsche 962 has dominated the Le Mans, its road going version didn&#39;t garner much attention &ndash; the Dauer 962 Le Mans. It was built by Dauer Racing, and its <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">racing version had won the 24 Hours Le Mans of 1994</em> with the help of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche\">Porsche</a>, thanks to the loopholes in the regulations. The engine specs were almost the same as of racing 962, but the company removed the air restrictor as it was a road car.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lister Storm</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lister-Storm\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Lister-Storm.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - scorpiocars</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The homologated racing beast designed and built by UK&#39;s Lister Cars in 1993, was energized by the Jaguar&#39;s 6996cc V12 engine. The GTS version of this oddball <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">participated in the GT1 class of 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995</em> and was up against the Porsche 911 GT2, Jaguar XJ220, Ferrari F40 and McLaren F1 GTR.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vector M12</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Vector-M12\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Vector-M12.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - gtspirit</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Remained in production from 1995 to 1999, the <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">company halted the manufacturing of Vector M12 because of its less demand</em> and the mismanagement of the organization too played a vital role in the exit of this vehicle from the market. You guessed it right! The car does carry a resemblance to the popular Lamborghini Diablo and it was based on the lengthened chassis of Diablo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cizeta-Moroder V16T</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Cizeta-Moroder-V16T\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Cizeta-Moroder-V16T.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - oldconceptcars</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The brains behind this Italian beauty were of Claudio Zampolli (an engineer) and Giorgio Moroder (a music composer) and it was <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">designed by the famous Marcello Gandini</em>. You will be shocked to know that this supercar was developed by <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">Lamborghini&#39;s ex-employees</em>. T doesn&#39;t mean Turbo here, as you might have guessed, but it stands for Transverse for the V16 (V8 + V8) unit mounted engine placed centrally.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bugatti EB110 SS</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Bugatti-EB110-SS\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bugatti-EB110-SS.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - imgur</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>How the discussion of supercars can end without Bugatti? Bugatti EB110 SS came into production from 1991 to 1995 and total 139 units were produced. However, the company ended its production too soon because the company decision to buy Lotus went wrong due to which it went bankrupt. The <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">sportscar</a> was loaded with a <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">V12 3.5-litre engine and was one of the fastest productions of that era</em> with the top speed of 217mph. It churned out a power of 650BHP and could cover 0-60mph mark in just 3.2 seconds.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The luxury saloon has played a pivotal role in communicating the German brand&rsquo;s philosophy of technology and advancement to its discerning customers and with every new generation of this famed model, things become more exciting and thrilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bollywood&rsquo;s love and appraisal for Audi has been elevated to an all new stature with the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/used/audi/2014-used-audi-a8-l-detail\">A8L</a> being the major attraction for the majority of the Superstars, especially Emraan Hashmi who is a proud owner of this beauty. Having a formidable stint with the renowned Q7 early on, it was time to get his hands on this gorgeous luxo barge from Inglostadt.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Emraan Hashmi's  Audi A8L 1\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/4-imran-hashmi.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - team-bhp</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The mere presence of this humongous masterpiece leaves everyone spellbound as they are captivated by its gigantic proportions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wide front radiator grille with the Audi logo exudes a charm and elegance of its own while looking purposeful at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new age LED headlights take the shape of a beautiful and stylish arc doing the magnetizing effect&nbsp;and taking&nbsp;the centre stage when it comes to accentuating the front appearance overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The side view beckons one to admire the colossal length.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;I will either come back after raising the Indian Flag in VICTORY or return WRAPPED in it.&rdquo;</em> &ndash;<br />Indian Armed Forces</p>\r\n<p>Such is the love and respect these men carry in their hearts that nothing comes in their way for protecting their motherland, not even their families or lives. We all know how tensed relations we share with our neighbouring countries such as Pakistan and China and the growing turbulence in Jammu and Kashmir. It is easy to comment on the current unrest in the country sitting at the comfort of our home but have we ever imagined the difficulties these <em style=\"font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold;\">MEN IN UNIFORM</em> actually face while dealing with such critical situations?</p>\r\n<p>Considering the tough challenges they face and the divisions they handle, we have tried to honor them by <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">choosing luxury car brands for them suiting their vigor and aura</em>. Though there are thousands of such divisions falling under the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Home Affairs, we have selected few ones to start with.</p>\r\n<h2>Indian Army</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Indian Army\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/2-indian-security-forces.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source- wikimedia and mercedes-benz</span></div>\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;To find us, you must be good,<br />To catch us, you must be fast, but<br />To beat us<br />YOU MUST BE KIDDING&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>With the motto <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&ldquo;Service Before Self&rdquo; </em>, the life of Indian army is of unmatched quality. By this we didn&rsquo;t mean that it promises a bed of roses or a life full of luxuries but it is extraordinary in every sense. It is very difficult to choose a single luxury car brand defining the machismo of our Army but to a certain extent <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><a href=\"/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a> may be able to justify the characteristics of Indian Army</em>. The <a href=\"/mercedes-benz/g-class\">G-Class wagen</a> from the German marque is one of the longest products of the brand that came in 1979 and is still present in the market. This heavy duty luxury pickup SUV is &lsquo;<i>built to feel like it&rsquo;ll last forever</i>&rsquo;!</p>\r\n<h2>Indian Navy</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Indian Navy\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/3-indian-security-forces.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -joinindiannavy and autoguide</span></div>\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;Sometimes we rush in after the storm,<br />Sometimes<br />We are the storm&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>Something you would proud to be a part of! The quality and level of life and the comfort given to the Indian Armed Forces can never be seen in the life of us civilians. However, don&rsquo;t dare to assume that what all they enjoy is comfort and facilities. Surrounded by the water 24*7 throughout the year is not an easy task and adding more to the woe is the separation from family for long periods of time.</p>\r\n<p>Now which car brand would suit the exotic life of Indian Navy? Probably Rolls-Royce! Talking about the relationship between the two, <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rolls-Royce and Indian Navy have been sharing the bond of partnership </em> since the inception of the latter for the modernization of the Indian armed forces. And hence, <a href=\"/rolls-royce\">Rolls-Royce</a> seems to be the perfect fit for Indian Navy because it is powerful, elegant and is a brand that one needs to earn not buy.</p>\r\n<h2>Indian Air Force</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Indian Air Force\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/4-indian-security-forces.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -indiandefencereview and aaarentcars</span></div>\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;Victorious warriors win first and then go to war,<br />While defeated warriors go to the war first and then seek to win&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>The sky above is not enough to calculate the limits of Indian Air Force as depicted by their motto &ndash; <b><i>Touch the Sky with Glory</i></b> &ndash; and that has also been proved, noted and jotted down in golden words in <a href=\"https://www.aviation-defence-universe.com/indian-army/\">the history of Indian Armed Forces</a>. Defining its ability, grandioseness and agility, the <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Italian beauty Lamborghini perfectly matches the qualities signifying IAF </em>. Both are the representatives of the cutting-edge technologies without making any comparison in any aspect and are a perfect blend of lightning and thunder. The recent encounter between IAF&rsquo;s Sukhoi SU 350MKI and Lamborghini Huracan is perfect to give this selection a thumbs-up!</p>\r\n<h2>Indian Coast Guard</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Indian Coast Guard\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/5-indian-security-forces.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -indiancoastguard and w-dog.net</span></div>\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that life ashore is distasteful to me. But life at SEA is better&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>Working in close assistance with departments such as Indian Navy and CRPF, the Indian Coast Guard division is full of challenges, engagement and adventure. Each day at sea comes with the task of fulfilling promises where each task is different and carries its own set of experience that is inimitable. For such a hectic profession, only a hard working luxury brand would suit &ndash; Aston Martin. The first preference of the James Bond series,<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> Aston Martin carries an unrivalled heritage</em> and each of its babies is dressed in iconic design and represents endless sophistication &ndash; just like our MEN in UNIFORM.</p>\r\n<h2>Border Security Force</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Border Security Force\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/6-indian-security-forces.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -google and landrover</span></div>\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;We live by chance,<br />We love by choice, and<br />We kill by profession&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>Generally known as the First Wall of Defense of Indian territories, the BSF is currently the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security_Force\" rel=\"nofollow\">world&rsquo;s largest force</a> guarding the border. Right from guarding the borders for maintaining peace within the country to keeping any eye and check on the transnational criminal activities across borders, BSF is loaded with huge amount of responsibilities and it need something that stands equivalent to it in terms of robustness, power and deliverability. And what&rsquo;s better choice than the Jaguar Land Rover that stands out to be the best match for it.<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> The award-winning SUVs by Land Rover carry legacies of their ancestors </em> and are designed to overcome the difficult terrains unaffectedly, just like our BSF.</p>\r\n<h2>Coastal Reserve Police Force</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Coastal Reserve Police Force\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/7-indian-security-forces.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -crpf.nic and ferrari</span></div>\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;Mastering others is strength, but<br />Mastering yourself is power.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>These lines justify the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) as well as <a href=\"/ferrari\">Ferrari</a>, which is the premium brand we have chosen for this service division. Where CRPF stands for strength and smartness and has the ability to work under extreme pressure and conditions,<em style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> Ferrari is synonym with agility, victory, power and vigor </em>. Both seems to be complimenting each other in terms of their performance and hence is the perfect match.</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",

The boomerang arc shaped LED daytime driving lights together with the circular shaped&nbsp;dotted indicator lights are the highlight of the show upfront.</p>\r\n<p>The chrome lined bars&nbsp;on either side contribute for the desired glaring specimen&nbsp;and on the whole a fierce menacing looking car takes you by surprise when you happen to get a glimpse of it in your rearview mirror.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the XF's design\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/7-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorbeam</span></div>\r\n<p>The side profile easily qualifies to be in a different league compared to the competitors, courtesy the majestic oncoming&nbsp;and the grand silhouette.</p>\r\n<p>The tempting look readily makes you go into a spate of praises for the artistic intellection doing spectacular&nbsp;honors to the XF's design</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The 18 inch Lyra alloys\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/8-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - indianautosblog</span></div>\r\n<p>The 18 inch Lyra alloys found on the bigger XF S variant now give way to the smaller 17 inch multiple spoke Libra alloy wheels.</p>\r\n<p>The new wheel option make the XF look a bit toned down but that&rsquo;s not a bad thing as it still gets second looks when cruising down a busy street.</p>\r\n<p>The rear spots two major differences, they being the absence of the &lsquo;S&rsquo; moniker which is inscribed on the 3litre variant along with the presence of a single exhaust pipe in place of the dual ones on the XF S . The curvaceous magnetic shaped LED braking lights are joined by a chrome fender lining, above which sits the Jaguar logo.</p>\r\n<h2>How&rsquo;s the Brit on the Inside?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the best interiors of all time\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/9-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -indianautosblog</span></div>\r\n<p>The thrilling setup&nbsp;perfectly conveys Jaguar&rsquo;s legacy and heritage to craft out the best interiors of all time.

What an incredible maneuver!</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the dashboard \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/10-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - indianautosblog</span></div>\r\n<p>The exquisite attention to detail is evident as one can touch and feel the rich quality materials used on the dashboard and on the well contoured seats.</p>\r\n<p>The central screen comes with a host of goodies in the form of navigation, TV tuner and a rear view camera!!!</p>\r\n<p>On a whole, a no nonsensical cabin that portrays nuances of both practicality and comfort at the end of the day is the real deal breaker.</p>\r\n<h2>Under the Hood</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The new age 2.2 diesel engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/11-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - indianautosblog</span></div>\r\n<p>The new age 2.2 diesel engine comes across as one of the most eager performer when compared to the Germans. Although it doesn&rsquo;t possess the nerve wrecking acceleration figures of the bigger XF S, but is enough to put a big smile on your face with its thrust on tap.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"eight speed gearbox\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/12-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - staticflickr</span></div>\r\n<p>The motor is mated to an all new eight speed gearbox and develops 190 bhp along with 450 Nm of torque and does a 0-100 timing in a modest 8.5 seconds with a top speed of 225 km/hr.The XF gathers pace rather well and when the turbo kicks in, it completely changes it character and unearths the real potential of the car.</p>\r\n<p>A void is surely felt in performance if one has had a tryst with the bigger sibling, but the transmission makes up for the gaps well and plays a catalytic role in enhancing one&rsquo;s driving experience.</p>\r\n<h2>Uncompromised Dynamics</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The XF \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/13-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - staticflickr</span></div>\r\n<p>The XF does not hesitate to be pushed around corners and meets your expectations rather well on this front. The ride quality is more comfy and pliant compared to the S variant since this car uses the 17 inch alloys. Undulations and rough patches are well taken care of together&nbsp;with causing little discomfort to the passengers inside the cabin. The steering is predictable at high speeds along&nbsp;and playing the satiating bit is the&nbsp;excellent braking performance to boast about.</p>\r\n<p>These outstanding features truly make the XF pick of the lot having a blend of sportiness and luxury.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Jamai Raja\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/14-ravi-dubey.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - twimg</span></div>\r\n<p>The Jamai Raja has surely stuck a chord with the mothers in law, just like his Jaguar has done so with <strong><a href=\"/blog/the-best-motor-races-around-the-world\">the car enthusiasts</a></strong>. We do hope to see Ravi Dubey in more entertaining television serials and add more cars in his possession.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Luxury is a state of mind, they say. However, it might not be totally true when we talk about Luxury cars; you need much more than just a state of mind to <a href=\"/collection\">own a supercar</a>. Luxury cars go way beyond what&rsquo;s necessary, these are things to give you comfort and once you experience the luxury- you cannot live without it!</p>\r\n<p>Now you may not be looking out to buy yourself a Luxury car, but here is a list of luxury car facts that are sure to make you want to get one right away:</p>\r\n<h2>1. The 1950s Cadillac Eldorado had a mini bar in its glove compartment</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"1950s Cadillac Eldorado\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/1950s-Cadillac-Eldorado.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source-assets.hemmings</span></div>\r\n<p>The Cadillac with its famous slogan <em>&ldquo;Standard of the World&rdquo;</em> was the leader in the postwar era in the luxury car world, outperforming its competitor, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packard\" rel=\"nofollow\">Packard</a>. In the 1950s, <a href=\"/used/cadillac/2008-used-cadillac-escalade-detail\">Cadillac</a> thought that it needed to come up with something different to show to stand out from all luxury cars that ever existed.</p>\r\n<p>So it came up with facilities- that might seem normal when you see them independently. But when you think that a car with all these facilities together existed at a time like that- it a kind of a BIG deal. It had electric windows, power lock system, memory settings and remote adjustable mirrors. If this wasn&rsquo;t enough- the car maker went a little crazy and fixed a drinking set for glove box. It also threw in elements for the girls &ndash; a <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">dispenser for perfumes with Arpege Extrait de Lanvin perfume</em>.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Daniel Craig has been gifted an Aston Martin for life</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Daniel Craig Aston Martin\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Daniel-Craig-Aston-Martin.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -dailypakistan</span></div>\r\n<p>If the world wasn&rsquo;t already enough for bond,<a href=\"/aston-martin\"> Aston Martin</a> offered Daniel Craig a free pass to drive ANY Aston Martin that pleases him for the rest of his life. And if you think that wasn&rsquo;t enough, <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">he also gets to test them on the racing tracks</em>. We&rsquo;re jealous!</p>\r\n<h2>3. The police department in Dubai consists of Bentleys, Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Aston Martins</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Dubai Police Cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Dubai-Police-Cars.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -autoexpress</span></div>\r\n<p>The most stylish police department in the world &ndash; Dubai&rsquo;s police department. So when it comes to Dubai, no one wants to be nabbed by the police. <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">One of its AED2m (USD 500,000) Lamborghini can speed up to 350kmph</em>. Their collection also includes a Kia Mohave and Land Cruiser.</p>\r\n<h2>4. The Engine of the BMW M5 is Actually Soundless</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW M5\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/BMW-M5.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -bmwusa</span></div>\r\n<p style=\"float: none; text-align: center;\"><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;Fake it till you make it.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p>The engine of <strong>BMW M5</strong> is in fact, without any noise, the voice is added so as to give drivers the feel of the car&rsquo;s performance. So the engine noise that you hear is, in fact, fake!</p>\r\n<h2>5. When Audi came to India, it created a new horn</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Audi \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Audi.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -autocar</span></div>\r\n<p>When Audi launched TT Coup&eacute; in Mumbai, it clearly stated that horns in India would require special attention and using the same horns the company had used in Europe would be useless. So the <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">horns used here are much stronger</em> since they are used too often here.</p>\r\n<p>Another least known fact about Audi&nbsp;is that an innerwear manufacturing firm in India named TT Garments filed a case against this German marque for using the name TT.</p>\r\n<h2>6. BMW recalled the GPS system in Germany as male drivers refused to get directed by a female voice</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW GPS system\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/BMW-GPS-system.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -bmwblog</span></div>\r\n<p>The help desk at <a href=\"/bmw\">BMW</a> got a number of calls from agitated German men who said that they were not comfortable taking instructions from a female voice. Funnily enough, it was just a machine giving out directions. However, that didn&rsquo;t stop their anger. And finally BMW decided to take off the GPS system with female voice assistance.</p>\r\n<h2>7. Thousands of abandoned luxury cars at Dubai Airport</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Luxury cars at Dubai airport\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Luxury-cars-at-airport.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -bmwblog</span></div>\r\n<p>Not just <strong><a href=\"/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a></strong> and BMW&rsquo;s, but you can find Porsches and <a href=\"/ferrari\">Ferraris</a> abandoned at the Airport. But, why do people just casually abandon their <strong><a href=\"/our-showroom\">precious luxury cars</a></strong>, you ask? Well, the answer is Sharia Law. Like most countries in the Middle East, the UAE also follows the Sharia Law, which states that <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">not paying debts is a criminal offense</em>. So, if you fall back on your payments, don&rsquo;t expect any bankruptcy protection and be ready to straight away land the prison. Harsh!</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>",

Remember those times when women used to stay indoors looking after the household, and men used to go out and were the only bread earners of the family? Let&rsquo;s just say that those were the days of the past. Today, we have <em style=\"font-weight: bold;\">women playing a vital role in every chore of life</em>, be it driving, wrestling or sports. Women are giving a neck in neck competition to men in almost every field.</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s know these 6 women who are strong, sultry and edgy, just like the cars they own:</p>\r\n<h2>1.

Participating in shows like Comedy Circus, Kaun Banega Crorepati and a short stint with Big Boss has made him a hit with the public of India.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Comedy Nights With Kapil\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/3-kapil-sharma.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - crybytes</span></div>\r\n<p>Venturing into his own production house K9, he launched his own show &ldquo;Comedy Nights With Kapil&rdquo; in 2013 which till date is a huge success and has high TRP ratings along with being a star studded show.</p>\r\n<p>He was awarded the &ldquo;Indian of the Year&rdquo; award by CNN IBN for the Entertainment Category.

This model departed&nbsp;from the retrospective styling from the olden days and became an instant hit with the young modern age buyers.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"elegant and exquisite SUV \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/7-kapil-sharma.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorbeam</span></div>\r\n<p>A stylish looker with the option of a <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>3 or 5 door catches people&rsquo;s attention out on streets.</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>This design language has a class of its own and is sure to melt hearts looking at that magnificent silhouette with the belt line originating meticulously and the coupe like roofline tapering a bit at the rear.</p>\r\n<p>Despite having a length of only 4355 mm it doesn&rsquo;t look that small, courtesy it&rsquo;s dynamic and muscular stance.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The car interiors\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/8-kapil-sharma.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -motorbeam</span></div>\r\n<p>The interiors have a rich taste and grandeur of their own with soft touch leather material and fine detailing on the dashboard.</p>\r\n<p>One can surely engulf himself in the lap of luxury and appreciate the sheer craftsmanship, dedication and conviction of the British automotive workers in coming out with such an opulent interior theme.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe width=\"860\" height=\"518\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6mRl-MzQo8?ecver=2\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n<p>The Evoque is powered by both petrol and diesel engines, the former being limited to the 3 door and catering to a limited set of clients.</p>\r\n<p>The latter being the choice for many out there comes with the 5 door option and sports the latest generation SD4 2.2 litre diesel engine churing out 187 bhp of power and 420Nm of torque mated to a 6 speed automatic transmission. Performance is decent with 0-100 kmph timing of 9.5 seconds and top speed slated at 210 kmph.</p>\r\n<p>The Terrain Response system fitted in this car makes it even more drool worthy and pick of the lot. This beauty excludes a solitary finesse of its own different from others going much in line with Kapil Sharma who adopts various techniques and practices to entertain the crowd.</p>\r\n<h2>Mercedes Benz S Class</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe width=\"860\" height=\"518\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0rmtzOIfWg?ecver=2\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>Superiority and dominance reckons the flagship variant</strong></span> from the Stuttgart car manufacturer&rsquo;s stable as it re-establishes the benchmarks and rules with a new iteration every time.</p>\r\n<p>Since the very beginning, the classic elegant design element with a lap of luxury has been fascinating one and all.</p>\r\n<p>The plus point being that even after so many years, put your hand on any one of its generations and you are bound to go head over heels in love with it. It has become an inseparable part of the wish list of many automotive enthusiasts out there.</p>\r\n<p>The S Class in its present form is leaps and bounds ahead of the previous models in terms of technology, comfort, drivability and the most important aspect being safety, for which a Mercedes has been an epitome. One tends to get enraptured by looking at the massive chrome finished radiator grille that now comes in a three dimensional shape with four louvers.</p>\r\n<p>The <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>large LEDs</strong></span>&nbsp;remind you of neat intricate gemstones shining bright that accentuate the visual appearance from the front.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes Benz S Class\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/10-kapil-sharma.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorbeam</span></div>\r\n<p>The skillful lines flowing from the front to the back convey dynamism and athleticism and bring out its subtle character from within.</p>\r\n<p>The tantalizing story continues further with one of the best quality interiors ready to pamper you with all the latest tech gadgets and faultless cabin ergonomics.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes Benz S Class an S 350 CDI\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/11-kapil-sharma.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorbeam</span></div>\r\n<p>Owning and driving one truly makes you feel on top of the world with an admiration for the hard work and struggle one goes through the initial phases of his career. It was the same for Kapil Sharma too who is now the proud owner of an S 350 CDI. The car houses a 3 litre V6 diesel motor generating 258 bhp of power and 620nm of torque.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe width=\"860\" height=\"518\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-JVgI-Qun8?ecver=2\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n<p>It is capable of doing some serious numbers in terms of performance figures but one would not like to tamper with its understated aura and charm that qualifies it as an elite cruiser.</p>\r\n<p>The 0-100 kmph timing is 6.8 seconds with a top speed of 250 kmph. Reckoning the fact, the S always has a special place in one&rsquo;s heart and the three pointed star comes out on top with its undisputed legacy and prestige.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"super talented comedian\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/12-kapil-sharma.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - wallpaperes.altervista</span></div>\r\n<p>With a net worth of Rs 40 Crores riding on him, Kapil Sharma is a force to reckon with in the industry.

At standstill, when the engine is idle, one wouldn&rsquo;t even know that there is a diesel unit functioning under the hood because of the excellent refinement levels of the motor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yyCPAREz8wY?ecver=2\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 0-100kmph timing is approx 7.2 seconds with a top speed of close to 240km/hr and this indeed conveys Q7&rsquo;s inherent potential and ability to come out on top as a real world performer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 4.2 TDI motor is mated to an eight speed tiptronic gearbox which is largely based on the mechanism of the six-speed unit, the main advantage here being that it is tuned to reduce fuel consumption by up to five percent thereby maintaining a balance between sportiness and practicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eight speed unit may not put a big smile on your face as the dual clutch S Tronic box, but still anticipates one&rsquo;s driving style&nbsp;and adapts to it intelligently.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dkgssYjUWew?ecver=2\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - youtube</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Q7 rides particularly well in city traffic and the way it takes on the bumps and potholes is worth applauding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apprehending the&nbsp;heavy weight and the &#39;fly in the ointment&quot;&nbsp;body roll at&nbsp;high speeds when&nbsp;in the mood to cut tight corners or burn some rubber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK! No problems</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The folks at Audi have an answer to every grouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advanced Audi Adaptive Air Suspension along with the its various modes&nbsp;is indeed a blessing&nbsp;and completely transform&nbsp;the Q7&rsquo;s on road mannerisms and dynamics by a mere flick of the rotary knob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It becomes a completely different ballgame once the Dynamic mode is engaged as it reduces the ride&nbsp;height&nbsp;thereby portraying the Q7 in the enthusiast&rsquo;s mind as an able machine for the extravagant indulgent episodes. More fun can be experienced when one wants to go off-roading and provision has been made for that as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The off road mode \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/12-varun-dhawan.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorbash</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The off road mode raises the body of the car to a certain extent so as to ward off the threat from potential physical obstructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mode allows for the nitty gritty deliverables to remain well under control.&nbsp;One can even raise the body height via the use of MMI without having to engage the off road mode (that&#39;s the nifty lift mode in action).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Q7 has done exceedingly well in a flurry of Q Drive events organized by Audi involving rough terrains to gauge the potential of the car and it has done exceedingly well on that front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The eggheaded Auto mode is well versed enough with your intentions and external recordings to present a quick witted form of the SUV at your beck and call.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"varun-dhawan\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/13-varun-dhawan.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - wallpapersdsc</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We surely hope to see Varun act more in rom coms and add more to his car collection so we at <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/about-us\">Big Boy Toyz</a></strong> get an opportunity to tell you more of the same.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end -->\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The Stuttgart assembly line has always come up with something unusual, be they are development prototypes, fire-breathing racers or oddball experiments sold to customers, the wildest creations by Porsche has always managed to grabbed eyeballs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the rich history that <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche\">Porsche</a> has, it is quite difficult to pick up its best creations of all time. Hence, on the basis of their production units, we have closed down to <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">5 rarest Porsches of all time that may give you a cargasm:</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/2-Porsche-Strassen-version.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source-wikimedia</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">Only 25 units are claimed to be built!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This supercar served as the mid-point in the development of GT1, which is the homologation special derived out of the extremely successful racing car. Despite having 911 in name, <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche/911\">the 911 GT1</a></strong> has very little in common with its parent car. Where most of its appearance was similar to that of Porsche 962, only the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">frontal chassis were carrying the resemblance to the 993 911.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/3-Porsche-Strassen-version.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -blogspot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It made its first public appearance at the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans. Owing to the grand victories of the GT1 in the races, the company planned to bring out the street-legal version of the award-winning GT1 to not let it limited to the tracks only. It was christened as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911_GT1#Street-legal_version\">Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion</a> and <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">cost around $912,000</em>. With 2535lbs body, this supercar was able to hit a top speed of 191mph.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1984 Porsche 911 SC/RS</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"1984 Porsche 911 SC/RS\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/4-Porsche-SC-RS.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -total911</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">Only 20 units saw the light of the day!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The delay in the Porsche 959 gave birth to the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/porsche/911\">911</a> SC/RS in 1984. The Rothmans, sponsor of the Porsche Group C race, were in the dire need of a racing car; hence 911 SC/RS came to rescue. The SC/RS had 3.0-litre engine rather than the much advanced 3.2-litre rear-mounted motor energizing the rear wheels. According to the available data, the maximum power churned out by the engine mated to a 5-speed manual tranny was <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">247BHP @7000rpm and the peak torque resided at 250Nm @6500rpm.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"1984 Porsche 911 SC/RS\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/5-Porsche-SC-RS.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -total911</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The race car was able to achieve a top speed of 244Kmph. Out of the 20 units built, 5 were assigned to Prodrive whereas the remaining models were sold as road cars under the &lsquo;Special Edition&rsquo; tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Porsche 356 America Roadster</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche 356 America Roadster\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/6-Porsche-America-Roadster.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -kingofwallpapers</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">Only 16 units were manufactured!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Produced exclusively for the US market, the name, Porsche 356 America Roadster, itself suggests its intended destination.

It was the lightweight version of Porsche 356 that finally made to the development of another piece of marvel &ndash; 356 Speedster. The company took the help of Max Hoffman, the US distributor, for exporting the limited units of this <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/sports\">supercar</a>.

The company produced 59 units of 924 Porsche Carrera GTSs out of which on 15 belonged to the GTS Club-Sport group. To many car enthusiasts, the<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> front-engined Porsche Carrera GTS CS is the ultimate driver&rsquo;s car </em>draped in countless motorsport parts to make it the real MONSTER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delivering 25HP more horsepower than the original Carrera GTS, the CS variant churns out 270HP of maximum power and can sprint from naught to 100Kmph in 5.2 seconds. Thus, the figures state that 924 Carrera GTS CS is faster than 911 Turbo of its era. What makes this beast a desirable possession is its<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> lightweight body with fiberglass panels</em>, Porsche 911 Turbo brakes, Porsche 935 seats, a factory aluminium roll-cage and a 2.0-litre 4-cylinder motor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Porsche 935 Street</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche 935 Street\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/9-Porsche-Street.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -performancedrive</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">A unique Porsche ever produced! ONLY ONE</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Porsche has been investing time in developing customized cars since the mid-1980s to meet the unconventional demands of the wealthy customers. The particular Porsche in question belongs to this category, which was<em style=\" font-weight:bold;\"> specially made for a Saudi businessman, Mansour Ojjeh</em>. He was the CEO of TAG (Techniques d&rsquo;Avant Garde) &ndash; the famous watch brand. He was very much impressed by the performance of the 935 racing car and hence wanted one for himself, of course, loaded with all the luxuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car was based on the brand-new 930 bodyshell and was equipped with the components of a race car. It came with a <em style=\" font-weight:bold;\">3.3-litre turbocharged motor that was tamed to churn out a power of 375BHP</em>. To give it a unique touch, the company enveloped it in a brilliant red color and provided cream leather seats by wood veneer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hope, you liked the exclusive collection of Porsche!

Being simple yet intuitive is the forte of Volvo and its view of luxury is very much different from its peers. Making <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">things easy is complicated and it requires confidence</em> to remove rather than to add but Volvo has overcome every such challenge to make the already complicated life simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/volvo\">Volvo</a></strong> is a Latin word which means <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&ldquo;I spin&rdquo;, &ldquo;I twist&rdquo;</em> but with time the meaning has evolved to be <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&ldquo;I roll&rdquo;</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right from its inception, Volvo has worked towards 3 core values &ndash; care for the environment, quality and safety. This isn&rsquo;t new with Volvo as time has proved that the company has made many innovations in the area of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/auto-guide/is-your-car-the-top-safety-pick-by-iihs-\">safety for its passengers</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Die-in-volvo-cars2\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Die-in-volvo-cars-2.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source-assets</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;In Sweden, care for people is a priority. Everyone is important &ndash; all life is important &ndash; and that has always carried through naturally into Volvo&rsquo;s ethos of car making. It&rsquo;s this care for the wellbeing of driver, passengers and everyone around the car that has always defined Volvo. And always will.&rdquo; </em>&ndash; <strong style=\"font-size:22px;\">Volvo Cars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volvo has claimed that by 2020 it will provide <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><strong style=\"font-size:22px;\">&ldquo;DEATHPROOF&rdquo;</strong> cars</em> and when it comes from Volvo, it&rsquo;s not hard to believe. Nonetheless, according to the last survey conducted by <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/driver-death-rates\" rel=\"nofollow\">IIHS</a> on the 2011 year models, out of the 9 cars that have <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">&lsquo;Zero Driver Deaths&rsquo;</em>, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/volvo/volvo-xc90\">Volvo XC90</a> 4WD is among the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Die-in-volvo-car-3\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Die-in-volvo-cars-3.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -ytimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s check out what in the history makes the ground for the company&rsquo;s claim to provide &lsquo;DEATHPROOF&rsquo; cars in next 3 years:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Addressing Safety Issues&ndash;</strong> Volvo is among the first automakers, which majorly focus on the safety of the passengers in their vehicles. In the year 1954, Volvo came up with a slogan &ndash;<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">We did not invent the car, but we set the safety standards</em> &ndash; and this slogan became the important pillar of this Swedish carmaker&rsquo;s corporate philosophy.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>5-years Insurance &ndash;</strong> Back in 1950s, the company was enjoying a good financial status in the market and it was so confident of its technologies that it started giving <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">5-years insurance in case of a car crash on all its vehicles</em>. No other carmaker in the history of automobile industry made such huge promise. But later, Volvo bade goodbye to this practice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Die-in-volvo-car-4\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Die-in-volvo-cars-4.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -seatbeltsplus</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also the first model to have v-shaped separate circuit brake system that works even when one of the circuits shuts down.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><strong>2-point Safety Belt &ndash; </strong>The year 1957 proved to be the revolutionary year not only for the Swedish automaker but for the entire automobile industry. Taking the pledge to improve the safety measures for its passengers, Volvo introduced the 2-point safety belt for the driver and front passengers in all of its cars. The next year, <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">the company stated to include this safety measure for the rear passengers as well</em>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>3-point Safety Belt &ndash; </strong> Volvo didn&rsquo;t stop there! One of its company&rsquo;s engineers, Nils Bolin came out with another innovative product to enhance the safety of the passengers and this is none other than the 3-point safety belt, which we are using till date. Volvo emerged out to be the <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">first carmaker to introduce this safety feature as standard equipment in all of its four wheelers</em>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Brake Booster &ndash; </strong>In the year 1965, Volvo came out with another innovative invention of the brake booster. Volvo Amazon was the first model to receive this feature. In fact, the same model marks the starting of medical experts&rsquo; views for the<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> front seats to support a healthy posture of the driver as well as the passenger seated in front</em>. According to many medical practitioners, a healthy posture is among other important factors that work towards vehicle&rsquo;s safety.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>V-shaped Separate Circuit Braking System &ndash;</strong> Another product from the stable of this Swedish automaker, Volvo 144, took the safety measure to next level. This was the first model to have 4-wheel disc brakes, all new locks on 3-point seat belts and a collapsible steering column.The <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">front and the back of the vehicle were made out of crushable energy-absorbing parts</em> to lower down the impact of the collision on the passengers and driver.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Die-in-volvo-cars-5\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Die-in-volvo-cars-5.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -Wikimedia</span></div>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Lambda Sond &ndash; </strong>It is an oxygen sensor, which is a catalytic converter technology that<em style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> helps in reducing the discharge of pollutants by up to 90%</em>. This electronic device measures the oxygen&rsquo;s proportion in a liquid/gas in an automobile to adjust the air-fuel ratio in order to let the catalytic converters work optimally. The company&rsquo;s engineers presented this sensor along with an exhaust catalyst in 1976.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Fog Lights&ndash; </strong> Volvo also became the first automobile company to use front and rear fog lights in its cars in 1987.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Die-in-volvo-cars-6\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/6--Die--in-volvo-cars.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -HubSpot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Intro of AIRBAGS &ndash; </strong>The same year, Volvo worked towards using safety belts with pre-tensioner to ensure better safety of its passengers. However, the major innovation by Volvo that proved to be the<em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\"> milestone for the automotive world was the introduction of airbags</em>.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Safest Cars of the World &ndash;</strong> Volvo hasn&rsquo;t stopped there as the company is continuously working to make its cars the safest vehicles on the planet earth. During the last few years, the company has brought some noteworthy and revolutionary safety measures at the same time that have made the foundation of the company stronger in the market. <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">A detection system for cyclists and pedestrians that automatically brings the vehicle to a full stop and airbags for pedestrians</em> are among the few exemplary innovations by Volvo in the safety area.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Die-in-volvo-cars-7\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Die-in-volvo-cars-7.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source -ytimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from this, the company has also introduced<em style=\"font-weight:bold; font-size:22px;\"> Alcolock system </em>that prevents the driver from driving the vehicle when the latter is under the influence of alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"blogList\">\r\n\t<li><strong>DEATHPROOF Cars by 2020 &ndash; </strong>Now the company is claiming or rather promising to bring DEATHPROOF cars by 2020, which means if you are driving in a Volvo car or <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUV</a>, you will not die or seriously injured unless you are a suicidal maniac. <em style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Volvo XC90 has already proved to be a DEATHPROOF car</em> as out of 111,610 exposures to accidents in America, none of the time the Volvo driver succumbed to his/her injuries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what&rsquo;s your take on the recent pledge by Volvo?

See this exquisite masterpiece from any angle and one is sure to be dwarfed by its enormous proportions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does share some peripheral&nbsp;bits with its predecessors in the form of the large bonnet styling,&nbsp;capital letter inscribed <strong>RANGE ROVER representing&nbsp;</strong>and the boxy look design from the side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But since we are in the 21st century and things have moved on, same is the appearance of the Vogue that has been an eye catcher with its <strong>flared up (say it two times)</strong>&nbsp;exterior design theme. We are particularly in love with the front look of the car which impresses with the wide head turner&nbsp;radiator grille and the signature new -fangled LED daytime running lights.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/anushka-sharma-tempting-7.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Save a few eye catchy moments for the ostentatious detailing&nbsp;of the lights,&nbsp;<strong>reminiscent of a camera lens,</strong> which&nbsp;take&nbsp;the crown for&nbsp;being&nbsp;showstoppers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The XXL side view is one to reckon with its majestic styling and architecture. The faux fendor vent graphics are now positioned on the doors and are a reminder of the older model&rsquo;s design language. The pronounced shoulder line&nbsp;throws in its bit&nbsp;giving the SUV a firm and dynamic stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/anushka-sharma-tempting-8.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The upper half(<strong>include the additive&nbsp;contrasting roof too!</strong>) has a distinct styling flavour, and raises the X factor quotient for the SUV considerably. The <strong>20 inch wheels</strong> with their meticulous detailing are never a miss hit and look attractive, while flawlessly fitting within the wheel arches.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/anushka-sharma-tempting-9.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The vehicle exudes a splendid aura from the rear too with a new age design for the LED tail&nbsp;lights in the form of squares arranged in a vertical pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A one stop for the ultimate extravagant luxury</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/anushka-sharma-tempting-10.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Once inside, the Vogue greets you with a lavish setup that simply takes your driving experience to a different level altogether. The <strong>ergonomic placement of the buttons and switches</strong> on the dashboard and central console is well within reach, and the well gripping steering wheel makes one feel as if he has been acquainted with the car for quite some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/anushka-sharma-tempting-11.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Range Rover engulfs a person in supreme comfort and luxury and this truly stands as a strong testimony for the brand that has enabled it to win tremendous accolades and appreciation world over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vogue is equipped with all things possible and pampers the passengers to the fullest and gives forth a pompous something else for the stately wayfarers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/anushka-sharma-tempting-12.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The adept&nbsp;central screen with its crystal clear graphics merits the big time&nbsp;attentive annexing with rebuttals. The one intriguing feature is the rising gear knob, also present in the Jaguar range of models that has become a hit with the enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One surely is kept busy and engaged when he lays his eyes on the control&nbsp;for the <strong>Terrain Response System</strong> placed below&nbsp;the gear selector knob.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/anushka-sharma-tempting-13.png\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The high quality seats of the Vogue</strong> do merit a special mention as they boast of one of the finest leather quality incorporated with a heavy dose of impeccable&nbsp;stitching.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>Imagine a typical Bollywood action scene between the Police and the thieves. The &ldquo;hero&rdquo; police officer comes out of the car, dusts off his uniform, aims at the bad guy and shoots them one by one. We are all so familiar with this scene aren't we?</p>\r\n<p>But wait a minute, let&rsquo;s rewind back a little. When the police officer got out of his car, which car did he get out of? The car must be as cool as the cop himself. Let&rsquo;s help you imagine better- <strong><em>here are the 5 Coolest Police Cars in the World</em></strong>.</p>\r\n<h2>1. Dodge Charger (Pursuit Edition): America</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-coolest-police-cars-in-the-world-1.png\" /></div>\r\n<p>This is the real deal when it comes to Police cars. With features like sirens and operating lights, Dodge Charger makes the police look <a href=\"/blog/uber-rich-supercars-making-their-debut-in-2017\">uber cool</a> and this is why <strong><em>this car is most popular with the American cops</em></strong>.</p>\r\n<h2>2. Lamborghini Huracan: Italy</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-coolest-police-cars-in-the-world-2.png\" /></div>\r\n<p>Better known as Italian Cops best weapon, <a href=\"/lamborghini/huracan\">Lamborghini Huracan</a> gives bad guys in Italy another reason to fear the police. This happened not very long ago in March 2017, when at a press conference, modified police Huracan was unveiled. <strong><em>This car comes packed with all gadgets that a police will ever need including a tablet computer for the cops!</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>You can also find a standard issue gun holster, VHF police radio, and a portable extinguisher as well.</p>\r\n<h2>3. Nissan GT-R: Abu Dhabi</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-coolest-police-cars-in-the-world-3.png\" /></div>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a police officer in Abu Dhabi and happen to have a soft spot for cars, then you&rsquo;re in great luck buddy. Way back in 2009, the police in Abu Dhabi decided that its time they got a Nissan GT-R in service. We can hear the people in Abu Dhabi going all <em class=\"redText\">&ldquo;My Cop Car if faster than your Cop Car&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<h2>4. Bugatti Veyron: Dubai</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-coolest-police-cars-in-the-world-4.png\" /></div>\r\n<p>Dubai Police has always been known for its insane collection of cars. With impossibly fast dream cars lining up the streets of Dubai, how can you expect the police to chase in bad guys in cars that don't match? That is exactly why they have added the <strong><em>Bugatti Veyron to their already luxurious collection of Lamborghinis, Audis, <a href=\"/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes </a>and more.</em></strong></p>\r\n<h2>5. Maruti Gypsy: India</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-coolest-police-cars-in-the-world-5.png\" /></div>\r\n<p>Wondering what Maruti Gypsy is doing on the list? Well there is no one that does not fear a Maruti Gypsy with a red horn blowing. <strong><em>A thief thinks twice before messing with a police in a Maruti Gypsy.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>If you think there is a country with even cooler cars and we did not mention it, then do mention it in the comments!</p>\r\n</div>",

The singing sensation, Neha Kakkar, has beautifully defined the speed of this piece of marvel in her song, &quot;<em>Love Te <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/jaguar\">Jaguar</a></em>&quot;. Talking about speed without Bugatti would be unfair to the brand as it has gifted us one of the best creations of the world &ndash; Bugatti Veyron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though its own sibling had snatched away the title of the &#39;<strong><em>Fastest Production Car of the World</em></strong>&#39;, the former&#39;s contribution to the automobile industry cannot be denied. Emerged out to be one of the most powerful and beloved car on the planet Earth, Bugatti Veyron has many facts that many of us are unaware about. Let&#39;s take a dig at the untold story of the mighty Veyron:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The energy released from the <a href=\"http://www.bugatti.com/veyron/veyron-164/#technology\" target=\"_blank\">W16 8-litre engine</a> at its full capacity could provide <strong><em>heat to around 10 homes during winters</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The radiator used in Veyron takes nearly 15 hours to be build and there are <strong><em>10 such radiators in a Veyron</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bugatti-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>- The brakes of the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\">supercar</a> can resist the heat of up to <strong><em>1800<sup>o</sup>C</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Each Bugatti Veyron&rsquo;s body can be split into <strong><em>3 parts</em></strong> only that are held together using merely <strong><em>14 bolts</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Like the car, the tyres used in it are also special &ndash; <strong><em>Michelin PAX tyres</em></strong> &ndash; which cannot be found in other supercars or normal cars. In fact, the rear wheels of Veyron are twice as wide as any other normal car and stands at 14.5 inches. And in case you need to change the tyres of the Veyron, you need to <strong><em>ship it to France</em></strong> and the <strong><em>total cost</em></strong> of the process would <strong><em>exceed $70,000</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bugatti-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>- The <strong><em>fuel tank</em></strong> of Bugatti Veyron needs at least <strong><em>8 days to get welded</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The <strong><em>deceleration rate</em></strong> to bring down a Veyron to a halt from 100Kmph of speed is <strong><em>lesser</em></strong> than that of the <strong><em>acceleration rate</em></strong> that is 2.5 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The fuel pumps used in a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/bugatti-veyron-sports-fast-even-in-slow-motion-1\">Bugatti Veyron</a> are capable of <strong><em>pumping fuel 8 times quicker than that of a normal car</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- <span class=\"redText\">At the highest speed of 407Kmph, the <strong><em>tyres of this beast can last for only 15 minutes</em></strong> and even the <strong><em>fuel tank</em></strong> of capacity 26.4 gallon <strong><em>gets empty in just 12 minutes</em></strong> when the car is at its top speed. Also, you will be shocked to know that the air intake of one of the fastest production car of the world at its max speed is <strong><em>47,000 litres per min</em></strong>. This is the amount of air that a <strong><em>human being breathes in 4 days</em></strong>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bugatti-4.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; Pinterest</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>- Where a single normal car takes a day time for production, a Bugatti Veyron, on the other hand, takes approximately <strong><em>6 weeks time to get ready</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The <strong><em>interior leather of Veyron is the outcome of high-breed cows</em></strong> that are raised at an altitude to avoid any contact with insects. This premium and blemish-free leather is simply flawless and appealing to eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bugatti-5.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>- At a time, <strong><em>only 2 technicians are involved in the making of a Bugatti Veyron</em></strong> so as to give proper attention to each of the minute details and nut and bolts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The paint job on each Veyron is done by a German company that worked on Porsche Carrera GT and <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\">BMW</a> Z8. To examine the same, <strong><em>it takes nearly 2 days in a light tunnel</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bugatti-6.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have more such amusing facts about the masterpiece that have not been listed above?

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>No denying the fact that our country is full of crazy people who derive pleasure in things that are rare and exclusive. The craze for SUVs has recently been on rise in India and the reasons are many but still nothing can beat the fan following of Jeeps here. Though Jeeps are quite popular in foreign lands, in India there are people who find solace in driving them and this is the reason why there exist some souls who have <strong><em>converted their Jeeps into the lowrider ones</em></strong>, despite of the fact that majority of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/auto-guide/roads-in-delhi-ncr-to-burn-some-serious-tyres\">Indian roads</a> don&#39;t support such rides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s meet these specially-carved machines that are sure to make you go weak in knees:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Dabwali Jeeps</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-2.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; JeepsDabwali</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Painted in black, you can find this monster in the northern part of India and looks aggressive, thanks to its <strong><em>modified chassis and wide tyres</em></strong>. The owner has designed it with lowered suspension, aftermarket fenders and split windscreen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Amandeep Jeeps</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-3.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; AmandeepJeeps</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t get shocked as the lowrider Jeep bears the name of its modifier and why not when the person has taken so much interest in beautifying the beast. Registered in the state of Maharashtra, the vehicle has been modified in the Land of 5 Rivers &ndash; Punjab. To reduce the height of the Jeep, it has <strong><em>used the Mahindra Bolero&#39;s suspension</em></strong>. Maxxis has formed the inspiration for tyres to make it a dual-purpose vehicle. The steering wheel&rsquo;s dimension has also been reduced to suit the new modification.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Yellow Lowrider</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-4.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; Facebook</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yellow is the color of hope and happiness and yes this lowrider has everything to make you happy with just one look of it. To give it the appearance of an off-roader, the bumper has been changed and is supplied with two hooks that have been painted yellow. Adding more to the masculinity and beauty of the vehicle are the <strong><em>Maxxis 760 dual purpose tyres with wide profile</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hotrod</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; cartoq</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Unique in itself, this lowrider looks much like a hot-rod. Tailored to remain close to the ground, this modified Jeep bears an Army number and comes with smaller tyres that don&#39;t steal away the charm of the vehicle. <em class=\"redText\">The steering wheel, for a change, is located on the left side</em> and instead of two seats, this lowrider comes with a bench to seat two people at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Superman Jeep</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-6.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; cartoq</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The image above might clarify all your doubts as it clearly shows the difference between the size of a regular <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/suv\">SUV</a> and the modified lowrider Jeep in the front. The Superman Jeep has been given a retro look and the credit goes to its wide profile tyres, LED headlights and exceptionally low suspension. And what makes this rider looks different from the others in the list &ndash; it&#39;s <strong><em>Superman sticker on the windscreen</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tractor Lowrider</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-7.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; cartoq</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Modified on the body of Mahindra Thar, this lowrider Jeep has got tractor wheel treads that are enormously huge in size. The vehicle has been given a silver color to projectify each of its customization, which include vertically modified exhaust pipe (like the ones you witness in a large truck) and <strong><em>off-road spec bumper with auxiliary lamps</em></strong> mounted on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Willy&#39;s Lowrider</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-8.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; cartoq</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the modified version of an original Willy that has been tailored in Punjab (must agree Punjabis are really unique!). <strong><em>What makes the machine look meaner is the black paint job</em></strong> that makes it look more aggressive and wild. Though you will witness large tyres on this lowrider, the suspension has been customized to make it look nearer to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Collapsible Windscreen Lowrider</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-9.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; cartoq</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Again yellow on board! The sunshine bright color can make every eye turn and <strong><em>what makes it more beautiful is its collapsible windscreen</em></strong>. There is no door in the vehicle and it can seat four people. Again Maxxis tyres to complement the butch and the chrome alloy wheels add more to the robustic looks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ghost Jeep</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/meet-these-9-crazy-lowrider-jeeps-10.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source &ndash; cartoq</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The LED headlights are the showstealer here, giving this black beauty the appearance of an aggressive black panther. This <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/hatchback\">four passenger vehicle</a> is an <strong><em>open-air one and the front metal bumper alongside chrome alloy wheels</em></strong> with Maxxis tyres make this lowrider really a stunner.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>It's difficult to define the craze car fanatics have for luxury cars. It would not be wrong to say that for them &ndash; <em style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Cars before bars</strong></em>. A single scratch on their four-wheeled baby could make their heart split into pieces. Well, it's worthless to say how obsessed they are for their exotic beauties and how heart-wrenching it is for them to leave their luxury drives alone even for an hour.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>However, there still exist some people who are cruel and insensitive at heart and have left these knights in shining armors unattended for years to die</strong></em>. Sad but harsh truth it is! As the list proceeds, it may tense your eyebrows but keep yourself strong and let us warn you, if you are weak at heart don't even think of scrolling down further to go through the list of the luxury cars that were left to die in India.</p>\r\n<h2>Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/rolls-royce-silver-shadow.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>Built between 1965 and 1980, this royal chariot came with 2 options in the engine &ndash; <em style=\"color: #ff0000;\">one with a 6.2-litre V8 motor and the other with 6.75-litre V8 mill</em>. As we all know, almost all the Rolls-Royce built till yet are still alive and running on road and the reason is simple &ndash; the life expectancy of a Rolls-Royce is far better than the babies from the other marques. But as we all know exceptions are always there and Rolls-Royce is no different. An owner decided to stop using his Rolls-Royce, which resulted in the abandonment of the car. <em><strong>It feels sad to see a Rolls-Royce dying like this, especially the vintage one.</strong></em></p>\r\n<h2>Range Rover Sport</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Range Rover Sport\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/range-rover-sport.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>When it comes to a <a href=\"/suv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">robust SUV</a>, Range Rover is the name that appears in most of the minds and why not the brand has established a good reputation in the market with it hard work and quality products. However, not everyone is born perfect and Range Rover too falls in that category. <em><strong>The previous generation of Range Rover Sport had witnessed some reliability issues, which might have resulted in the disowning of this luxury drive by its owner.</strong></em> The reason is unclear why this Range Rover Sport is standing deserted in one of the Mumbai's police station but this is sure that it has been standing there for quite a long time now.</p>\r\n<p><em style=\"color: #ff0000;\">For the unversed, Range Rover Sport is the smaller product of the marque that is available in a wide variety of engine options, which range from 3.0-litre V6 diesel motor to a 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine producing a maximum power of 500BHP.</em></p>\r\n<h2>BMW 7 Series</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW 7 Series\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-7-series.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>Right from the Badshah of Bollywood to the <a href=\"/blog/celebrities-who-once-had-pre-owned-cars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">God of Cricket</a>, BMW has many of its ardent fans who consider it to be the best ride available on the planet. But not everybody thinks the same and somewhere it hurts right at the centre of the heart. <em><strong>From the Chris Bangle's designed last generation of 7 Series, this luxury sedan, deserted in Maharashtra, has been battered badly for the reasons unknown.</strong></em> Available with the engine options of 730Li, 745 Li, 760Li and 730Ld, the 7 Series is one of the most purchased sedans from the Bavarian's portfolio.</p>\r\n<h2>Lamborghini Countach</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini Countach\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-countach.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - TeamBHP</span></div>\r\n<p>Rarest of the rare cars available in India, Lamborghini Countach is a legendary car that entered into the phase of production from 1974 to 1990 and since then it had won many hearts because of its sharp angular body and aggressive looks. <em style=\"color: #ff0000;\">It was a mid-engined sports car that drew its power from a naturally aspirated V12 engine.</em> Any car enthusiast would dream of owning this beauty as now it will be counted as a vintage collection but somewhere in India this old vine is rusting in pieces.</p>\r\n<h2>Porsche Carrera 2 Turbo</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche Carrera 2 Turbo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/porsche-carrera-2-turbo.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>Available with rear wheel drive system, this Porsche's baby is popularly known as Type 964 where its removable roof made it one of the rarest collections among supercars that are no more in production. <em><strong>The model above is waiting for its owner in Goa since long to clear the custom duty levied on it.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><em>Porsche Carrera 2 Turbo came with a <em style=\"color: #ff0000;\">3.6-litre flat-6 cylinder engine</em> that churned out a max power and torque of 247BHP and 310Nm, respectively.</em></p>\r\n<h2>Mercedes-Benz SL-Class</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Mercedes-Benz SL-Class\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/mercedes-benz-sl-class.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>Once counted as the flagship model of <a href=\"/mercedes-benz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, this two-door roadster drew its name from the abbreviation of Sport Lightweight. <em><strong>The idea behind this beauty was to create a toned down version of a Grand Prix car.</strong></em> One of the most powerful roadsters of its era, this true-blue sportscar was energized by a 5.0-litre V8 petrol engine that delivered 302BHP of power. The car above is counting its last days somewhere in Chennai.</p>\r\n<h2>Porsche Boxster S</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Porsche Boxster S\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/porsche-boxster-s.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>The image above might break the heart of many car enthusiasts seeing the condition it is now in at one of the police stations of Delhi. The police seized the car when its owner rammed it into a pillar and wall after losing control on the beast. <em><strong>This two-seater convertible comes with Porsche's one of the best engines &ndash; 3.4-litre flat-6 cylinder motor.</strong></em> This powerful motor was able to transit a power of 326BHP and a torque of 360Nm.</p>\r\n<h2>Ford Mustang</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Ford Mustang\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ford-mustang.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>Ford has finally launched its one of the most popular cars in India &ndash; the <a href=\"/car-news/ford-mustang-gt---the-story-unfolds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mighty Mustang</a> in all its new avatar. Though the vehicle has been available since long in the international automobile market, in India the car enthusiasts had to wait for a considerable long period of time to get their hands on this exotic beauty. <em><strong>But there were few car fanatics who imported this legendary car in India to prove their elegant taste and unique style statement.</strong></em> Well, seems like one of the imported Mustangs (shown above in the image) had an owner who didn't take the good care of the baby and left it to get rusted in its old age.</p>\r\n<p><em>This is the Mustang in its older form counting its last days in Mumbai in open as no one cared to take care of this icon.</em> An old Mustang is a very rare scene to witness in the current scenario and has attracted many vintage car collectors to try their luck on one.</p>\r\n<h2>Rolls-Royce Phantom</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Rolls-Royce Phantom\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/rolls-royce-phantom.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p>Another Rolls-Royce in the list! Though Rolls-Royces are built to last, few people don't invest their time in taking care of these babies. <em><strong>According to the data released by the company, around 65% of the Rolls-Royces are still alive on the roads.</strong></em> The above Rolls-Royce Phantom has been lying abandoned on the port of South India. Seeing the body of the beast, one cannot say that it is about to die unattended.</p>\r\n<h2>Lamborghini Gallardo Balboni</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini Gallardo Balboni\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-gallardo-balboni.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cartoq</span></div>\r\n<p><em style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Your eyes might shed tears after knowing that this is the only Gallardo Balboni limited edition car in India and only a few are left throughout the world.</em> This limited edition met its unfortunate destiny after meeting with an accident on the roads of Delhi.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>They say that legends are born once in awhile, but Ford Mustang is that piece of marvel that repeats its legendary victory every year. Introduced in the year 1964, this American pony has <em style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>completed its successful 53 years of long run without missing even a single year of production</strong></em>, which is quite an achievement in itself considering the changing trends and needs of the society. Call it the effect of the name or simply the true engineering traits, Mustang&#39;s racing prowess is undoubtedly the best in its class. Many of us have been die-hard fans of this legend but there are few things about Ford Mustang that we were unaware of. Here are some of them to give you an adrenaline rush:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Breakout Hit</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-2.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - mustangsdaily</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It at least takes a year or so for a new name to establish its say in the market but as we say, Ford Mustang is iconic in every sense and this is the reason why this new nameplate reached a soaring sales volume in the first two years of its launch in the market. <em style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>On its first day of launch, the company claimed to sold more than 22,000 units of Mustang</strong></em>, which reached to a figure of 4,18,810 units by the end of the year. The demand was so high that in its early days, the company was selling the Mustang as fast as it could build it. Within two years the company sold more than 1 million Mustangs, whereas it was forecasted that Ford couldn&#39;t even cross the mark of 1,00,000 units of Mustang in the first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>By 1965, it became the most popular car of America.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">The first Mustang was sold Accidently</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-3.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - classiccarlabs</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the first model of Mustang was a <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/convertible\" target=\"_blank\">convertible</a> with serial number 5F08F100001 that was a preproduction model intended to be used as a sample for promotional purposes and not for selling but it was sold accidently to a Canadian who was an airline pilot by profession. <em><strong>It took almost 2 years for Ford to convince Stanley Tucker (the first customer) where in exchange he took the 1 millionth 1966 Mustang.</strong></em> <em style=\"color:#ff0000;\">(A very poor deal I must say)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-4.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - classiccarlabs</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first model is now residing in the <a href=\"https://www.thehenryford.org/visit/henry-ford-museum/\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Ford Museum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Racing in Blood</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-5.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - knfilters</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mustang has been born with a racing blood and this is the reason why it has been able to register many races on its name in 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000s. Some of the notable wins include the names of 67 short track oval feature race and NHRA Pro Stock title. <em><strong>The winningest Mustang in the world belongs to John Force, which has proved its winning capability in 44 races.</strong></em> In fact you will be shocked to know that the first ever Mustang was made to run on the Grand Prix circuit at Watkins Glen and it was only a few seconds off from the Formula 1 race cars&#39; times.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Ford Mustang a Ford Cougar?</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-6.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - pinimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Going by the early sketches of the Mustang, one may found out that the in 1963 many emblems and badges were created and designed with the name Cougar but the extensive market research made the company settle on the name Mustang. However, later the company unveiled another model by the name Mercury Cougar, so the name finally got used in some other form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another story that revolves around this American pony was that <em style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>its name has been inspired from a P-51 Mustang fighter plane of the World War II</strong></em>. The Designer, John Najjar, pitched the company with this name but the company rejected it saying that the name is too airplaney. Lately he pitched the same name but this time as a type of horse and the company accepted. Other suggested names for the car were Torino, Avventura and Allegro.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Red Mustang - The All Time Favorite</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-7.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - lanestrains</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em style=\"color:#ff0000;\">People generally settle for light colors when it comes to cars, either they are buying economy cars from Maruti, Honda, etc. or luxury cars from the house of BMW, Mercedes, Audi and many more. But like we said earlier, Ford Mustang is a class apart. Among all the colors available for Mustang to choose from, the maximum sold out color was Red followed by Blue, Sliver, White and Black. In 80s and 90s, 1 out every 5 Mustangs was painted red.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Mustang is a Popular Movie Hero</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-8.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - media-cache</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>No, we are not saying that Ford Mustang has been named after a popular Hollywood hero but this car has played the role of a star in many movies, credits to its good looks and legendary performance. <em><strong>Bullitt was the first movie to feature Ford Mustang and this might have propelled it to the star status it earned from McQueens.</strong></em> The company even released a model named Mustang Bullitt on the 40th anniversary of the movie. Apart from these two, Mustang also appeared in <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/blog/cars-bond-cars\" target=\"_blank\">James Bond series</a> &ndash; Goldfinger and Diamonds, and as Eleanor in Gone in 60 Seconds. Overall the figure has crossed the mark of 3000, including TV shows too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Awards Winner too</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-9.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - pictures.dealer</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only Ford Mustang has made its prominent place in our hearts but has won many awards since the time it breathed its first. <em><strong>It received its first award &ndash; <em style=\"font-size:22px;\">Tiffany Gold Medal of Excellence in American Design</em> &ndash; in 1965 and became to first car to receive this award.</strong></em> Other awards&#39; names include the likes of Car and Drive Ten Best List for the years 1983, 87, 88, 2005, 06 and 2011. It also registered 1974 and 1994 Motor Trend Car of the Year Award on its name.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Sold for $1.3 Million</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-10.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - mecum</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be surprised to know that <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ford/mustang\" target=\"_blank\">Ford Mustang</a> was sold for $1.3 million in an auction in 2013. <em><strong>The model was the 1967 Shelby GT500 Super Snake, which was a rare model with only 1 production unit.</strong></em> In fact, most of the Mustangs have touched a price bracket of $500,000 to $1 million at bids, which make this model extremely valuable at such bids.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Ford Mustang Convertible Went Missing for 10 Years</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-11.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - media.ed</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, for the consecutive 10 years, that is, from 1973 to 1983, the convertible Mustang was not into production due to some mysterious reason. The company took long time to realize that people&#39;s love for Mustang was majorly based on its retractable roof feature. <em style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>It went back into production in 1983.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Unique Way of Promoting Breast Cancer Awareness</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-12.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - autuko</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ford left no stone unturned to make the society realized that it cares for them and this is the reason why the company <em style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>released a special edition of Mustang by the name of &quot;Warriors in Pink&quot; to promote breast cancer awareness and to raise money</strong></em> to donate to the charities fighting for the cause. The company successfully raised more than $120 million for this noble cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">Iconic 50th Birthday Celebration for an Icon</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-13.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - pursuitist</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The model completed its successful 50 years in 2014 and to celebrate it in a unique way, the company took the <em><strong>parts of the newly refurbished 2015 Mustang GT convertible in a freight elevator to the Empire State Building&#39;s top to assemble it in the sky</strong></em> to mark its return in the market with a new design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-weight:900;\">High on Publicity</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/about-ford-mustang-14.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - classiccarlabs</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of its launch in 1964, it adopted a smart advertising strategy and for that it paid a hefty amount to 3 major TV channels to aware the mass about the upcoming launch. <em style=\"font-size:22px;\"><strong>Nearly 2600 newspapers published the Mustang&#39;s launch and more than 29 million people viewed it.</strong></em> The company even put hoardings of its launch in 60 high traffic places in US, covering 180 markets, including billboards, airport terminals and Holiday Inns.</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end --></div>\r\n",

Why? Because the thing with Mexico is that they don&#39;t take &#39;license&#39; as the way to certify an eligible driver, but to monitor. Hence, defeating the very purpose of the tests. <em><strong>If you&#39;re 15 and in Mexico, then you can easily manage a permit to drive in under $100.</strong></em> And, once you&#39;re 18- then you become eligible to get the full licence. Not to forget, there will be no driving, written or medical tests that they would need from you. Pretty shocking, eh?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>India</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/easiest-driving-tests-3.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cardrivingtipsindia</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we are there second on the list and no, you there isn&#39;t no need for shock. The driving tests here are terribly simple (comparing it to global standards). <em><strong>In most places, the test is as simple as just being able to drive in a straight and line and turning left.</strong></em> If you can do that, TADAA, you&#39;ve got your license. Oh, and if you&#39;re not in mood for a tests, then rumor has it that many people get their way out by simply bribing. Pretty sad, but equally true!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Honduras</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/easiest-driving-tests-4.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - ticotimes</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a country located in Central America. If you have given enough driving tests and are struggling to get one then maybe it&#39;s time for you to move to Honduras. <em><strong>This place has no driving tests, whatsoever- the only thing they want is that you should have crossed the age requirement i.e 18 years.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pakistan</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/easiest-driving-tests-5.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - wikimedia</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Reason why Pakistan is fourth on the list is because they do have driving test, even though the test is so easy that no one can expect to fail. <em style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><strong>They don&#39;t require you to have any amount of minimum hours of training.</strong></em> Giving a medical test, however is a must.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Egypt</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/easiest-driving-tests-6.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - thetravelphile</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>So earlier in the days, the driving test was a mere formality but gradually, they have become a little strict and now, you are required to give a <em><strong>written test as well where in you must get 8 out of 10 questions right</strong></em>. They test your parking skills as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>South Korea</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/easiest-driving-tests-7.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - cdn1-pri</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now this one is definitely tougher than the other countries on the list! <em style=\"color:#ff0000;\">First of all you need to be 18 before you get a license and secondly, they need a minimum of 13 hours previous training experience.</em> This has been brought down from 25 hours. Once you&#39;ve done all this, you need to go through a written and driving test. Once you pass this, you need to pay $400 and BAM! You have your license!</p>\r\n<!-- blog content end --></div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>A bike with speed thrills and retro chills!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dating back to the medieval era of 1950&rsquo;s in England, cafe racers started to make an appearance. The term cafe racer itself emerged because of the working class&rsquo;s need to travel along highways which featured travel cafes, catering to the needs of those on the move. The cafe culture emerged when rockabilly (classic rock for you and me) artists started performing at these cafes. With stripped down bikes as their transport, rock music to listen and good food to go the cafe racer culture started to emerge. These cafes were home to stock bikes being modified and given the unique cafe racer stance we see today. But back in 1970 when the bike industry in England hit a bump, the cafe culture was eventually dropped. Fast forward to the current times and seen is that some special motorbike companies such as Triumph have this legend alive with their modern take on the classic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bike-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Introducing the Triumph Thruxton R. A bike that is here to appeal to your heart, yet confuse your mind. It looks retro but the moment you ride it, behaves as if it is ages ahead. On the looks front, the Triumph&rsquo;s designers have hit it out of the park. Personify the bike&rsquo;s actual character and you dream about Mike Hailwood donning Valentino Rossi&rsquo;s shoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bike-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The round headlamp which incorporates a DRL without spoiling the retro look, the fat, sticky Pirelli Corsas and the beautifully sculpted tank all take you back to the times. Look closely and you see the racier side of things with upside down forks and twin Brembo discs powerful enough to stop the Earth. The engine, true to its classic roots is a 1200cc parallel twin fed by fuel injectors disguised to look like carburetors. Riding this beastly motor that places 115 NM of torque in your palm is supremely easy owing to the modern tech you have on tap. Drive by wire, ABS, Traction Control and riding mode selectivity let you push the limits of this bike without killing yourself. All these electronic aids can be switched off in case the purist in you wants the raw edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bike-4.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bike-5.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a bike that mixes nostalgia with fuel to give you an average of smiles per kilometre! It is for the adrenaline paleophile who appreciates a bygone era and detests to go completely modern. From the cafes of England to the highways of India, it represents an era that refuses to be forgotten all over the world. It associates you to an image you live with forever. India is one such country where cafe racers of have started to gain popularity in recent times.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bike-8.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Avid followers of the biking culture also would recognise Michelin starred celebrity chef Gary Mehigan showcasing the cafe racing spirit on his visit to India. As he expressed on his show <i>&ldquo;Far Flung, with Gary Mehigan&rdquo;</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>&ldquo;I have done some biking in my age. Bikes are my release and I cannot help when I see beauties like these.&rdquo;</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infiniti Q50<br />\r\nWitness this beauty at Big Boy Toyz.

But according to experts, <em><strong>Rolls-Royce Sweptail is expected to be based on the platform of the current generation Phantom and is supposed to be powered by a V12 6.7-litre engine with 453BHP of max power</strong></em>. Despite being a coupe, for a touch of luxury, the two-seater coupe has been stretched to over 6 meters.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/rr-sweptail-15.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - businessinsider</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>What you have to say about this distinctive and ostentatious piece of excellence crafted with love by the designers at Rolls-Royce?</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Go through everything that has happened on the face of this big blue dot in the universe. Be a walking talking encyclopedia for that matter, but you won&#39;t be able to answer what I&#39;m going to ask you. So, think hard before you retort - <u><em>Can you give me one example of anything that comes to your mind that has been and will be on the face of the Earth forever?</em></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I bet there is not one thing that occurs primarily. Time is a phenomenon that has the capability to make everything obsolete. Let alone materialistic stuff, you and me and humans in general are heading towards extinction. Yes that&#39;s a very far-fetched thought but it is happening and there&#39;s no denial. So where do you and I who consider ourselves car enthusiasts fit in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been a lot of evolution in the automobile industry over the years. From Carl Benz making the world&#39;s first motorable car in 1886 to Tesla introducing semi - autonomous driving technology on its cars, we have come a really long way. During this evolution of the motor car, we have left behind certain things in favour of better ones to come. Inevitable as it can thought of. One such victim of this continuous process of evolution is the mighty V12 engine. For those who know their cars, they know why a V12 is considered the holy grail, the king of all other engines. Think of engines as animals and thy will be the Lion. Yes there might be bigger engines than a V12, they might be more powerful than it too but the V12 marked the commencing of an iconic era. An era which is seeing the last of its days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a heavy heart, let me tell you why.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/v12-engines-3.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - pinterest</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The V12, which you can essentially think of as two straight six engines joined at the crankcase, is one of the smoothest engine configurations ever made. Straight six engines themselves act as the primary and secondary balance and having two banks of six cylinders in a V12, all the vibrations are cancelled out within the engine itself without using any additional balance shafts. This makes for an engine that gives you smooth silky power delivery over the entire rev range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another aspect of a V12 engine, perhaps its most loved characteristic is the symphony it makes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"color:#ff0000;\"><em>YES, IT&#39;S NO CRASS CACOPHONY, IT&#39;S AN ACTUAL &#39;BEETHOVEN-Y&#39; SYMPHONY</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One has to hear it to believe it. Aural pleasure is key to a sports car and the V12 delivers, and boy in a fantastic manner! Legendary cars such as the</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mclaren F1</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/v12-engines-4.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motortrend</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\" target=\"_blank\">Lamborghini</a> Diablo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/v12-engines-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - autodrome</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>and the <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari</a> F50</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/v12-engines-6.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - supercars</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>all have V12 as their choice of engine. There is a long raging debate over natural aspiration and forced induction and which one is better and you have to accept, nothing sounds as good as a naturally aspirated V12. Instant power delivery and razor sharp response makes for a sense of excitement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Isn&#39;t that what <em>thou</em> want?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But as we see the dawn of the day, V12 engines are on the last leg of their glorious love affair with cars. Emission control rules and regulations and the hunger for more horsepower has pushed us towards smaller turbocharged engines which make the same (or even more) power much more efficiently while being smaller in displacement. They let out less pollutants and are comparatively frugal too. Very few manufacturers today have a naturally aspirated V12 in their product range. The Italians being one of the most stubborn in this area. Aston Martin too ditched their 6.0 Litre V12 in favour of a twin turbo one from AMG.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/v12-engines-7.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - circlesix</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>The AMG built twin turbo V12 in the new Aston Martin DB11</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today cars are more about capability. Not the driver&#39;s capability but the car&#39;s capability to go as fast as possible. Cars are engineered today to go around a track in the least amount of time. Dual clutch transmissions, rear wheel steering, turbos, magnetorheological engine mounts and infinite amount of electronic witchcraft have made it all possible. Take the Porsche 918 for example. It is a brilliant car and certainly one of the fastest around the track. But it is so advanced that it takes the driver out of the equation and does the driving part for you. A naturally aspirated V12 that makes as much power as say a Twin turbo V8 will ask you to rev its heart out rather than delivering it all low down. Screaming all the way to the rev limiter, the engine would feel alive under your feet. Also, you&#39;re going to have a hoot doing that, even if it is slower.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center; color:#ff0000;\">The times V12 lovers are going through right now are best explained by that one high school girlfriend you had. You know it&#39;s not going to last, but for the time it does, it will be stupendously fun making you grin from ear to ear!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:22px;\"><u><em><strong>Here&#39;s a smiling V12 for you!</strong></em></u></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/v12-engines-8.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - automanager</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

We all love a fast sporty Mercedes with the AMG badge and the spin chilling power it offers, but have you dwelled in deeper than that? I guess not. Allow me to elaborate.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/one-man-engine-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p><a href=\"/used/mercedes-benz/2012-used-mercedes-benz-c63-amg-detail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes AMG GmbH</a>, or more commonly know as simply <strong>AMG is the high performance division</strong> of <a href=\"/mercedes-benz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes Benz</a>. Founded and based in Affalterbach, Germany it has been taking mercedes cars from its &lsquo;<em>regular</em>&rsquo; lineup and has been making totally bonkers like almost on the verge of insane performance versions.</p>\r\n<p>Originally an independent firm in itself, their work on Mercedes cars gained such acclaim that Daimler-Benz bought a controlling share in the firm. Over the years it was so well received that in 2005 Daimler-Benz became its sole owner. AMG stands for <em>Aufrecht Melcher</em> <em>Grossaspach</em>. Hans Werner Aufrecht (A) and Erhard Melcher (M) who were partners, while Aufrecht's birthplace of Grossaspach (G) was how the name came to be. But you don&rsquo;t want to focus on that too much partly because of the fact that it is near impossible to spell and pronounce for you and me. Lets just call AMG &lsquo;<em>Ahh My God</em>&rsquo; shall we?<br />Okay sorry lets not.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/one-man-engine-4.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>Leave alone the average person, even the casual enthusiast does not know is the level of dedication that goes into an AMG car, specifically its engine.</p>\r\n<p>AMG is one of the few companies in the industry that still focuses on hand built engines. At AMG they follow the philosophy of one man, one engine. It showcases the level of emotion that a <strong>single builder</strong> puts into a <strong>single engine</strong>. Only the employees with the maximum experience are employed here. They consider their hand made engines as pieces of art. If the engines didn&rsquo;t have to go in a car, they would probably take them home and consider it as their children!</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/one-man-engine-5.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>Each engine is honoured with an engraved plaque of the builder&rsquo;s signature. The factory at Affalterbach runs at an easy pace which ensures each engine is perfectly built to the satisfaction of the builder. Each and every part of the engine ranging from the main block to the pistons are scanned via codes. These codes are fed into tablet computers present with each builder keeping a record of the parts going into a engine while guiding the builder as well.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/one-man-engine-6.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The engine in picture here is the super exclusive Twin Turbo V12 for the Pagani Huayra built by AMG</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each engine component is oiled before being put together to ensure the harmony that a well built engine is. The only machine used in building a complete engine is a nut and bolt tightener, testament to the dedication of the company to deliver hand crafted masterpieces. After the completion of every engine, every builder affixes an engraved plaque on the engine that bears his signature. It is moment of pride for every builder. Seeing his name on the engine knowing that he built it all by himself creates a sense of accomplishment in them.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe width=\"860\" height=\"518\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2an7l_khho\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - you tube</span></div>\r\n<p>The plaque attests to the quality of the engine. With engine configurations ranging from inline fours to big behemoth V12s, AMG has come to be one of the most flexible, yet true to its roots brand. I think Mercedes should rename AMG as &lsquo;I (A)m the (M)aster of this (G)rowl. It&rsquo;s better than speaking gibberish isn&rsquo;t it?!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>Here are some gobsmacking pictures of outlandish AMG cars from the Mercedes stable.

This is achieved by switching of an internal flap inside the front spoiler between two positions. The different air passage paths then either provide a <strong style=\"color:#33cc33\">minimal drag</strong> or a maximal downforce depending upon the configuration of the internal flap previously mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva Front Spoiler\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/aerodinamica-lamborghini-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - forceg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a <strong style=\"color:#33cc33\">rear active wing</strong> too, which consists of another such valve-shaped-flap internally present into the main wing structure. This is also integrated for dual purpose solving, i.e. the maximizing of downforce in high speed cornering situations for stability and the other for minimizing of drag once the car starts to accelerate and gain speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva Rear Wing\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/aerodinamica-lamborghini-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - i.ytimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually these two flaps work in conjunction with one another to provide a profound complete effect on whatever action the car&rsquo;s computer decides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon activation of the ALA system, whenever throttle is floored and the car accelerates crazily, the spoilers position themselves so as to minimize drag. When a corner is encountered, the configuration is such that maximum downforce is obtained and the car stops with a good brake bite and aids the carbon ceramic rotors eventually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> say that this braking assist solution adds a whopping 750% addition to the mid corner stability in the braze zones on track.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva ALA System Off\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/aerodinamica-lamborghini-5.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - icdn-9</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva ALA System On\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/aerodinamica-lamborghini-6.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - i.ytimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"color:#33cc33\">NOW, IT MUST BE OCCURRING TO YOU AS THE SAME SOLUTIONS WHICH FERRARI&rsquo;S BEEN USING FOR THE LAFERRARI WHERE THERE ARE BOTTOM MOUNTED FLAPS ON THE UNDERBODY PROJECTIONS UPFRONT AND AT THE BACK</strong>, or that it is just a computer which once used to handle the active aero packages on the rear wing, now is assigned a task to take care of the frontal flaps too.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/aerodinamica-lamborghini-7.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - automobilemag</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is much more complex than that.

The differential unit tackles the outer wheel losing traction by selective power and torque delivery to the inner cornering wheel for instant pulling and perfect execution of the turn maneuver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cars like some Audis, BMWs, Acuras etc use this technology in their sports sedans and track special counterparts</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color:#ff0000\"><font size=\"5\">EVER HEARD OF SOMETHING CALLED AERO-VECTORING???</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say you&rsquo;re driving a Lamborghini integrated with the ALA dynamics. You&rsquo;re on the track and are pushing the limits off this bull you&rsquo;re riding.

They put in all their blood, sweat and tears into their passion, just to introduce to the world a piece of craftsmanship that is exquisite. Such is the case with <a href=\"/lamborghini\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lamborghini</a> too. Anyone who has been following Lamborghini religiously, knows that the company rose to fame from the brink of shutting down forever. As with any other low volume supercar manufacturer,</p>\r\n<p>Lamborghini too, was struggling with its finances 1973 onwards. It also went bankrupt in 1978. <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Talk about a better example of getting up after you fall!</strong> Post bankruptcy the company was sold by its owner Chrysler Corporation to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power. Further down the road in 1998, Lamborghini was again sold to the Volkswagen group and placed under Audi's control.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Since then there has been no looking back. </strong></p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; color: #ff0000;\">The birth of the modern day Lamborghini.</h2>\r\n<p>The one model that pioneered this change was the <a href=\"/used/lamborghini/2008-used-lamborghini-murcielago-lp-640-detail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Murcielago</a>. It introduced a lot of <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>firsts for the company</strong></span>. An <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">All wheel drive system</strong> was introduced which is now a signature Lamborghini trait along with manufacturing and quality control supervision from Audi. The V12 remained however, making a recipe that was destined for success. This makes the Murcielago the first modern day Lamborghini.<br />Let's have a closer look at it.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Streamlined Exterior</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The exterior of the Mercy\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/tangerine-beast-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>The exterior of the <em><strong>Mercy</strong></em> was designed by Belgian designer <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Luc Donckerwolke</strong> who was also&nbsp;heading&nbsp;Lamborghini's design department from 1998 to 2005. The signature scissor doors create the visual drama that these cars are known for.</p>\r\n<p>The split spoke <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">'Hermera'</strong> wheels made of <strong><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">aluminium and the air intakes make this car not just stunning to look at but also functional</span></strong> <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(read: fast!)</strong> Around the rear are glass engine louvers that allow you to see the engine and the single oversized exhaust outlet that allows the V12 to shout. There was also a time when the Murcielago was banned in certain countries because of its exhaust volume. It was too loud for the government regulations.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Interior</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Murcielago's interior is best\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/tangerine-beast-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>The Murcielago's interior is best described as functional simplicity. Once you sit in the car, the only job you have at hand is to grab the steering wheel and savour the V12 engine for yourself. The configuration has been enjoying <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">halo status</strong> and rightly so.</p>\r\n<p>The interior is simple, but do not confuse it for bare bones or uncomfortable. The leather wrapped bucket seats and dash lend it a rich feel along with the colour contrast of black and orange making it catchy for the eye. The leather is double stitched in the <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">marmalade-y accents</strong> too.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Under the hood</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"behemoth 6.5 liter engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/tangerine-beast-4.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>Under the glass engine cover lies a <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">behemoth 6.5 liter engine</strong> consisting of 12 grand cylinders in a vee or V configuration. This engine can trace its roots back to the history of Lamborghini in the 1960s. Coupled with a <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">6 speed e-gear transmission</strong> with launch control, it sends the bull into a relentless charge down the road. All the <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">640 horses</strong> are contained by the <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">4WD system</strong>. In Spite of great traction the Murcielago is considered one of the most difficult to drive cars of all times because of its raw and unpredictable nature, just like a real bull.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">TAME IT, DRIVE IT.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 19px;\">The Drive</span></h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Driving a V12\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/tangerine-beast-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - auroraobjects</span></div>\r\n<p>Driving a V12 is a life changing moment. At least we&nbsp;think so. The moment you hear it scream at full chat, you cannot go back to being the same person you were. <strong style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The sound seems like it has a soul. That is the experience Lamborghini wants you to have.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The e-gear module with paddle shifts allows you to change gears without ever making a mistake with the steering. It is important because the car demands you to be on your toes and respect it. It inspire you and gives you the adrenaline rush like no other car can. The 4WD system lends it immense grip in all situations and a very violent launch from zero to insane speeds.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Lamborghini\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/tangerine-beast-6.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - </span></div>\r\n<p>The launch of this car was a turning point for Lamborghini. It was its first car under Audi's ownership. It had to introduce new things which worked out in its favour while keeping the core essence of the company intact. The old notion that Lamborghinis were unreliable and broke down every now and then was starting to change slowly. Audi's engineering expertise helped them while their flair took them to the top of the Supercar market where they stand today.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Lamborghinis are a class apart, as they themselves say -<br /><br />\"We are not supercars, we are Lamborghini\"</strong></p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe width=\"860\" height=\"518\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbZt32qN6lA\"></iframe></div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>",

The time during World War I was extremely difficult for Germany as they were short on planes &amp; their parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This led to a merger between <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Rapp Maker &amp; Otto Werke,</strong> both being aircraft manufacturing firms to join hands to meet the needs of the airforce. Post this period, the <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Treaty of Versailles</strong> also prohibited them from manufacturing fighter jets. OtteWerke&#39;s owner was the son of a person who was a Maestro in making four cycle engines useable &amp; ultimately being used in every car engine out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This technology was patronized by the <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">legendary fighter pilot Red Baron</strong> as it made its presence in the engines of the airplanes &amp; simply was outstanding. Courtesy the above treaty debarring the Germans from making any more planes, this led to a diversification of business for BMW which shifted interest &amp; focus to motorcycles &amp; subsequently automobiles in 1928.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">After all sheer dedication &amp; hard work from the teams at <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/bmw\" target=\"_blank\">BMW</a>, sun did rise for the Bavarian propeller.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The much acclaimed four cylinder engines of the 1960&#39;s having proved its worth of being one of the most fuel efficient became the epitome design of BMW&#39;s headquarter which was incorporated by an Austrian architect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to know more about those grilles you love so much?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read on, bud.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the front radiator grille - the kidney grille of BMW\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-history-3.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - pinimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The most eye catching part of a BMW is the front radiator grille, known as the <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">kidney grille</strong>. Seeing them undisguised &amp; unchanged for such a long time, one cannot simply help but simply mistake it as beemer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making its debut on a <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">BMW 303</strong> back in 1933, they are even more distinctive to look at &amp; recognize compared to the <strong style=\"color:#039;\">blue &amp; white</strong> logo. One has to move with the changing times &amp; innovate according to the market taste &amp; preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WHY DID IT TAKE BMW TO GO BUZZY BUZZ BUZZ?</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>DID THEIR BATTERY HAVE SOME FUZZY FUZZ FUZZ?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Come, Let us find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em style=\"color:#039;\">Going Electric for</em> BMW isn&#39;t all that new. They came out with a model in 1972 but it didn&#39;t hit the market though. Having a decent speed along with the battery quality not being up to the mark and performance levels being half of what the cars were having at those times,it was not difficult to guess that why BMW did not go buzz with this invention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest deterrent being that the battery lasted for only about 20 minutes but that did not stop the Bavarian Automaker to learn, <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">capitalize on shortcomings and prepare for the future.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\"><img alt=\"The BMW S1000RR HP4\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-history-4.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - zerotohundred</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.bmw-motorrad.com/com/en/bike/sportbikes/2016/s1000rr/s1000rr_overview.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong style=\"color:#03F;\">The BMW S1000RR HP4</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BMW is credited with making the planet&#39;s fastest motorbike in 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we as numb nuts always thought Ducati is the undisputed leader of em all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some notable features that differentiated it was that it had a supercharged engine &amp; capable of achieving a top speed of 278 km/hr. One could not ride it without wearing the safety gear as riders do in fancy production bikes of modern age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, it is the only company to <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">discard the use of telescopic forks</strong><em>(which we thought was a convention)</em> on its motorcycles &amp; a staggering <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">82000</strong> examples were produced in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Side racing cars was originally not an invention by BMW. The very basis of an effective cornering ability due to the leaning out of a car is as old as the concept of sidecars themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Side racing car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-history-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorsport</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The much awaited corporate tie up between <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">BMW &amp; Lamborghini</strong> in 1970 to build a sports car actually didn&#39;t materialize. The Germans had the onus to provide the engine &amp; suspension parts while the rest of the work was slated for the Italian engineers on the mid-engine beauty, composed by the master <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Giugiario</strong>. Due to some unforeseen financial concerns, the Italian automaker had to pull out of the deal leaving the project at the final stages. But that did not deter their neighbors as they went back to their sketching boards &amp; churned out this beast in totality, giving birth to the legendary <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">M Sports car</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The M10 four cylinder engine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-history-6.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - theautomotiveculture</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Making its presence felt in the Formula One Championship was in fact a dream come true for BMW. The <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">M10 four cylinder</strong> engine was an evolution of the motor that first debuted in production models of 1962 with <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">75 bhp</strong>. In 1983 the engineers using their skill &amp; acumen were able to revolutionize it &amp; increase the overall output by up to <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">1400 bhp</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">This truly was a blessing in disguise for Nelson Piquet who won the competition based on this revamping &amp;modification of the classic motor.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A taste of the retro Bavaria:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the retro Bavaria\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-history-7.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - pinimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A faceoff with the rival Mercedes Benz also took place in the 50&#39;s. BMW was nearing bankruptcy in 1959, the prominent cause being the cold war. The three pointed star took this as an opportunity and was literally gearing up for a takeover. The Bavarians mounted a counter attack enrolling even their lowliest mechanics to buy back shares in the company thereby keeping the workforce intact &amp; honoring their commitment towards the organization. This was followed by a large investor by the name of <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Quandt</strong> taking control of the company &amp; till date his family owns a majority part of this automotive organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a parent company &amp; having a wholly owned subsidiary of two major British Automobile brands <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Mini Cooper &amp; Rolls Royce</strong>, instills confidence along with a high degree of trust in the eyes of potential buyers who then start relating the three automotive giants. It is a win-win situation for all participants as vital parts sharing can be done without having to incur a high cost while at the same time brand proposition can be conveyed in a versatile &amp; unique style.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW the ultimate driving machine\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-history-8.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - automobilemag</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Having read this article, I believe that people will garner more faith &amp; trust in BMW. The slogan &amp; tagline saying <strong style=\"font-size:22px; color:#ff0000;\">&#39;the ultimate driving machine&#39;</strong> has been in business for more than 35 years now and still continues to be the USP of the brand. Setting benchmarks &amp; levels on all parameters &amp; fronts is one thing that BMW can accomplish very easily. At the end of the day, all apprehensions &amp; speculations take a back seat when you are greeted with a car that stays true to its character &amp; meant to give you that undefined <strong style=\"font-size:22px; color:#ff0000;\">JOY</strong> that has <strong style=\"color:#ff0000;\">no limits</strong> &amp; bounds and that truly is a BMW for sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BMW Cars\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/bmw-history-9.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - ranwhenparkeddotnet</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The ultimate Bhai of Bollywood, Salman Khan always manages to stay in the news for reasons good or bad. For some fans, Salman Khan is the most generous of all stars in bollywood while others seem him as the bad boy.

This is showcased perfectly by the <a href=\"https://www.bentleymotors.com/en/models/continental/continental-gt.html\" target=\"_blank\">Continental GT</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A car designed to munch miles down at lightning speed while giving you a relaxing massage. Let us&nbsp;lead you into the opulent world of the Bentley Continental GT.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Imposing yet classy Exteriors</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Bentley the Papa B\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bentley-Continental-gt-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The outside of the Big B is unmistakably like a Bentley. It is big, round and imposing. Unlike other highly capable sport cars, you won&rsquo;t find sharp lines and aero ducts, because well, <strong>it&rsquo;s a Bentley which apart from being extra luxurious, turns out to be highly speedy too!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The front has a character of its own with the rounded&nbsp;headlamp setup with jewel like LED lights and a big black mesh grill for that sporty touch. The sides of the Bentley are well sculpted with a <strong>muscular shoulder line</strong> running around the back and <strong>20 inch 5 spoke wheels</strong> giving it a big contact patch on the road. Come around the back and you see the curviness or the design neatly culminate into a round back end that is finished off with twin <em><strong>figure eight</strong></em> style tailpipes and rectangular tail lamps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:18px;\">THE BENTLEY PLAYS IT WICKED YET, INNOVATIVE.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:18px;\">INSTEAD OF GIVING US QUAD PIPES ON EITHER SIDES, BENTLEY HAS CRUNCHED THE OVALS TO GIVE A SINISTER LOOK TO THE NEWLY FIGURE 8-STYLE PIPES.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"NEWLY FIGURE 8-STYLE PIPES\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bentley-Continental-gt-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AREN&rsquo;T THEM NEW AND BUTCH?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Just like an Englishman would regard in slang.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong>Opulent Interiors</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Opulent Interiors\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bentley-Continental-gt-4.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The interiors draped in <strong>Newmarket Tan</strong> give you an impression of a plush sofa as soon as you sit in. The leather is soft and supple to touch with quality at par with a <a href=\"https://www.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/en-GB/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rolls Royce</a> if not better. Now that is a very big statement, having a car comparable to the undisputed king of luxury on wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>fiddleback eucalyptus wood veneer</strong> is the perfect contrast to the <strong>tan</strong> colour. The smell of the leather conquers your senses as soon as you open the door and that is what you want. You want to be cocooned in luxury away from the elements while you belt down highways and backroads all while the car inspiring oodles of gentlemanly character inside of you!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"inside the car\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bentley-Continental-gt-5.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The three spoke steering is a delight to hold although it does not give you sports car like feedback. The air vents and switchgear finished in <strong>knurled metal</strong> is the best surface you can touch inside the car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The cold metal feels sinister too, against your skin giving a clinical feel to the car.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Under the Hood</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Continental GT\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bentley-Continental-gt-6.jpg\" /> source - st.motortrend</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the hood of the Continental GT lies a 4 litre twin turbocharged petrol V8 that was an<strong> Audi development initially</strong>. But the engine that goes under the hood of a Bentley is modified and given a rawer and louder character. The same engine is found in the <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\" target=\"_blank\">Audi</a> RS7 but in the Bentley, it feels way different. It produces a clean 500 horsepower and 660 nm of torque which is enough to propel this <strong>land yacht</strong> to great cruising speeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>8 speed auto</strong> takes care of managing the cogs while you focus on feeling rich. Harnessing all that power is a 4 wheel drive system that ensures no drama (This is no wheelspinnin junkie) and all go on all road conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:18px;\">WITH ALL THAT TORQUE AND POWER, YOU ARE COMPELLED TO THINK&hellip;<br />\r\nWHAT SORCERY HAS BENTLEY PUT INTO THIS THING?<br />\r\nHOW IS IT SO WICKEDLY FAST?<br />\r\nHOW CAN IT DO ALL THIS STUFF, BEING A 2 TONNE BIGGIE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">The Drive</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Bentley\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Bentley-Continental-gt-7.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The drive of the Bentley continental GT is unlike any other car. Even the other models from the Bentley range cannot compare to the experience this car offers. You sit in a cocoon of luxury feeling like a king and rush down corners at great speed without feeling any of the road, and in a good way! That is what the Bentley is supposed to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The V8 under the hood lowers the weight on the front axle as compared to the earlier used W12 thus improving the cornering reflexes of this car. The four wheel drive ensures maximum grip and control. All this is further proven by the <strong>0-100 time of 4.6 seconds</strong> and <strong>a top speed of 297 km/h.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong style=\"font-size:18px;\">WAIT.<br />\r\nEYES WIDE OPEN?<br />\r\nMOUTH DRY?<br />\r\nTHIS, IS THE GT, FOR YOU.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, the Continental is a car for that individual who loves being in control of things, loves to drive yet does not want a compromise on style or luxury. It is for that high class individual that enjoys time behind the wheel as much as he loves his business meetings and high tea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em style=\"font-size:18px;\">This Bentley, is for men not boys!</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s a look at the Bentley GT on offer at BigBoyToyz Gurugram:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tUeIZzvRSpI\" width=\"860\"></iframe><span class=\"imgRef\">source - you tube</span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

But now after it&rsquo;s been implementation on 1st July 2017, the clarity of its benefits to the consumer domain has nothing but increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Allow us for a briefing: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a concept which has taken India by storm. Originally aimed at introducing a one tax regime along with fairness and transparency, the GST brings with it a flurry of advantages and benefits for the common man which can be realized over a long term period. It also strengthens India&rsquo;s position on the global platform. One of the many advantages that this concept has brought forward is the slash in the prices of cars by a significant amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, with the much hyped and anticipated <strong>Goods and Service Tax (GST)</strong>, many reasons have come along to double the joys of potential car buyers in India. <em><strong>And by potential car buyers, it is not only the conventional buyers who are rejoicing, but the people who are willing to buy expensive, high end sports and luxury cars too.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BIG BOY TOYZ sports and luxury cars \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/big-boy-toyz-after-gst-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the central government has now fixed the tax amount on high end CBU (Completely Built Unit) cars, which are imported to India for sale, at just 20 lakhs. <strong>In addition, the cars costing over 5 crores will now see a price chop of about 1 crore.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>THE BBT ADVANTAGE:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here comes a company which is ready to give you an extra hand and takes you a step closer to your dream car, <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/collection\" target=\"_blank\">Big Boy Toyz</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"BIG BOY TOYZ\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/big-boy-toyz-after-gst-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Big Boy Toyz, being a super exotic car dealer aims at passing this benefit on to its customers to strengthen its bond with them. With the GST tax regime in place, we are pleased to announce a significant drop in our prices on the machines you dream to own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em><strong

Norton, Indian, BSA, Triumph, Enfield - these are the most common brands that come to mind when you think about retro bikes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past few years retro bikes <strong>(now called modern classics)</strong> are making a massive comeback. Triumph with the whole <strong>Bonneville</strong> range, Ducati with the <strong>Scrambler</strong> and Harley with its <strong>Street</strong> range are all creating incredible retro classics. These bikes have mass appeal for 3 simple reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. A lot of people who rode motorcycles in their younger days connect with the brand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. A lot of people who are young today and want to get into biking find these accessible both to ride and buy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The manufacturers are doing a splendid job of preserving the classic heritage (names, design etc.) but building these bikes with modern technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every now and then comes from this genre of modern classics a bike so distinctive in its look that it feels like a piece of art rather than a motorcycle. The <strong>BMW R9T</strong> is one such example. But it was not in the reach of most people, especially in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently Triumph launched the <strong>Bonneville Bobber</strong> and that to me, is another such distinctive modern classic. If you are a motorcycle enthusiast, I dare you to get close to one in person and if you don&#39;t go weak in your knees, <em>I&#39;m happy to buy you unlimited beer (or coffee)</em>. Such is visual aesthetic of this bike. If Steve Jobs would have designed a modern classic, this is what he would have created. It simply looks stunning from every angle!!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">She&#39;s got the look !</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"1200 cc parallel twin motor\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/triumph-bobber-2.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - azureedge</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Under a beautifully sculpted tank is nestled a compact and great looking <strong>1200 cc parallel twin motor</strong> with the most distinctive retro styling - the polished air fins, the faux carburettors that are actually efi modules, distinct Triumph badging all in a totally chic blacked out theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then as you move back, there is the solo seat that looks straight out of the 1960s. It is perhaps the coolest looking seat on any motorcycle in my opinion. Then you have the slammed rear end with full fender. This part of the bike&rsquo;s styling is controversial, but looks stunning to me. Then you have the slammed front fender with a small circular headlight and forks covered in rubber gaiters to complete that bobber look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most distinctive styling element besides the seat are the twin exhausts. They are slammed and low and give the bike an extremely muscular look from the rear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like I&#39;ve said earlier, <strong>I don&#39;t think there is a better looking modern classic motorcycle out there !!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then Triumph has a bunch of ultra cool accessories to further enhance its character. I have on my bike a cool wax leather saddle bag mounted to the rear end and a couple of retro analogue gauges (one tells time and the other temperature) right next to the handlebar switchgear. Boy do these simple things enhance its visual appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">There she goes&hellip;.!</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"RetroCool with the Triumph Bobber\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/triumph-bobber-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motorcycle-magazine</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so enough about the looks. <em><strong>All that glitters is not gold</strong></em>. So if it looks so good, it must ride like crap <em>(aka HD 48)</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve ridden my bobber for about 2000 km. Most of this has been city riding. I have changed the stock rear suspension with a rox unit (supplied as an accessory by Triumph).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first time you sit on the bike</strong>, you feel its small proportions. The tank is small and narrow. The seat height is relatively low, so you can easily plant your feet on the ground. It feels like you&#39;re sitting in the bike and not on it - <strong>and this is two thumbs up in any riders&rsquo; book. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Triumph Bobber Bike\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/triumph-bobber-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - visordown</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Then you fire the engine to life.</strong> It has a delicious sound thanks to the <strong>uneven firing order</strong> of the parallel twin. Then you pull in the clutch, which is light as a feather and engage the first gear, which is smooth as butter. You twist the throttle and that&#39;s when you first realize that this bike is not all show. It launches like a pocket rocket thanks to oodles of torque and exceptional mass centralisation. And that delicious exhaust note turns into a thunderous roar every time you twist the throttle.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Triumph Bobber Bike\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/triumph-bobber-5.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - cycleworld</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finally, you start rolling</strong>. You are comforted by the smoothness of the engine and the crispness of the throttle response. She meanders through city traffic like a hot knife slicing through thermocol. That raspy growl of the exhaust gets your AdrenaSense going. Everyone looks at you with shock and awe. You feel you&#39;re the coolest person to walk on the face of the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Triumph Bobber Bike\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/triumph-bobber-6.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - thebikeshed</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And then you come to a turn</strong>. You know this is a modern classic that rides well. But you have most certainly assumed that she can&#39;t handle for nuts. You&rsquo;re cautious. You brake, downshift and gently tip her in. <strong>She turns on a dime</strong>. Huh! You tell yourself, that was not supposed to happen. The next turn you give it some more go and boy does she turn again on a dime. The more you ride, the more she impresses with her dynamic abilities. <strong>This is where Triumph has pulled a rabbit out of the hat</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\">Too cool for school</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Triumph Bobber Bike\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/triumph-bobber-7.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - pipeburn</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Triumph Bobber is a sort of a maverick in the modern classic genre (<em>literally like the character Tom Cruise plays in top gun</em>). She is gorgeous, aggressive and wants to break away from the clutter and establish her own identity. But when it matters, she is fiercely capable and will put a huge smile on you everytime you see her and everytime you ride her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My only gripe is the rear suspension travel. It&#39;s too less for our Indian roads and the bike tends to bottom out very quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She looks like a million bucks, rides like ten million and makes you feel like a hundred million!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>And that&#39;s why she&#39;s RetroCool.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Triumph Logo\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/triumph-bobber-8.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - face37</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">*****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BigBoyToyz feels privileged to have &lsquo;Petrolheadnerd&rsquo; pen down an autobiography of his love affair with the Bobber.

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>What does <strong>True Adventure</strong> mean in the motorcycling world? For some it means the thrill of riding all the way to an exotic location like Leh or Spiti. For some it means the kick of getting off the beaten track. For some it means the satisfaction of endless riding from dawn to dusk. For some it means the adrenaline rush of being on a large motorcycle. And for some it means the joy of being out with one&rsquo;s riding buddies away from the chores of daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me it&#39;s a little bit of all of these. All of us have important things and important people in our lives...but some of us are privileged enough to take a short break from that every now and then, get on a motorcycle to go to some random (<em>or not so random</em>) place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chance to be with people who have nothing to do with our everyday lives, but share our insane passion for motorcycling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>To listen to classic rock tunes of Floyd under the stars.<br />\r\nTo eat our hearts out.<br />\r\nOr to burn it to the ground.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>And most importantly to laugh our guts off</strong>. And if you can combine this with a truly great destination and route - then that is True Adventure for me. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"True Adventure\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-2.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - petrenaandtheg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2><em>The Trip</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"True Adventure Trip\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motoroids</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>So 3 of us set of from Delhi to Udaipur, roughly 700 km away on our adventure bikes. There was the magnificent <strong>Triumph tiger 1200</strong> explorer, the glorious <strong>Ducati Multistrada Pikes Peak</strong> and the newest addition to our stable - the mighty <strong>Africa Twin</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main purpose of the ride was to be at the media test event of the Africa Twin launch at Udaipur. We were joined by 2 other esteemed owners of the new Africa Twin on their steeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started from Gurgaon at 6 am in the morning. The skies were pregnant with rain and we were hoping the gods would allow us a few hours of &ldquo;windy weather&rdquo; riding. The gods obliged and we had a magnificent run of about 350 kms till Kishangarh. That&#39;s where the skies burst open and in a few minutes we were pelted with harsh rain. Such was the intensity of the rain that one would be hard pressed to imagine one was in Rajasthan. We soldiered along and rode through another 350 kms of intense rain to finally reach Udaipur by around 4 pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then enjoyed Honda&rsquo;s hospitality which was magnificent. They had a fantastic evening planned with imminent media people and their leadership team along with new Africa Twin customers - a pretty unique mixture. We enjoyed a lazy Saturday walking around the beautiful city of Udaipur. The bike was serviced there - a wow moment !! And then we set back for Delhi on Sunday. I&#39;ve not been to a lot of media events, so I don&#39;t have a benchmark but in absolute terms HMSI&rsquo;s organisation and hospitality was incredible. <strong>Hats off to Vikas Raheja and his brilliant team !!!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ride back was equally exhilarating. We started around 6 am and were back in Delhi by 4 pm. There wasn&#39;t much rain so the weather was really nice. But the roads were in bad shape and there were a lot of stray cattle and motorists to keep us entertained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So all in we did about 1400 km in 20 total and 16 riding hours. This itself is a testament to the Africa Twin&rsquo;s prowess in Indian conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Company</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"True Adventure with the Africa Twin\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - honda</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Like I said earlier, for me the company is as important (if not more) than either the bike or the destination. I had my best riding buddy with me (we have ridden endless distances together and done a lot of crazy shit on bikes). I would never ride without him. And then we had one of our newer riding buddies with us who has endless energy (and a great classic rock collection, and can make great coffee, and has the craziest explorer ever). We also had 2 other Africa Twin customers and really enjoyed their company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From endless banter over our Scalas, to endless cups of coffee, to endless classic rock sessions on our trusty Bose portable speaker, there is no more joy than hanging out with a few people you connect with over a biking trip. We roamed Udaipur like tourists, visited the quaint German bakery, had lunch at Ambrasia by the lake on a beautiful windy afternoon and were then back to our classic rock sessions and endless cups of coffee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this trip had another surprise for me. On Saturday evening I bumped into 2 motorcycle journalists I really admire in India - <strong>Shubrata Marmar (Shumi)</strong> and <strong>Karthikeyan Singhee</strong>. I&#39;ve been following them for years and it was awesome to meet them and spend a few hours chatting with them about motorcycles - these guys are simply awesome!! The only other person on my top list is <strong>Sagar</strong> from <strong>PowerDrift</strong> and I hope to meet him soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Bike</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The Bike\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-5.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - totalmotorcycle</span></div>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\"><em>To say that the Africa Twin was impressive during this, would not be an understatement.</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing you notice is its nimble size and lightweight character. Now this is not a light bike. It weighs 245 kgs fully filled. But it feels more like 150-175 kgs. Then its profile is so narrow that you have extreme confidence in lane splitting and getting off the road to beat traffic jams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recall that there was this one toll that had a truck infested traffic jam for at least 3 kms and it was raining hard. But we just gently moved on to the slush to the left of the road (2 feet wide at max) and cleared the whole thing in no time. You&#39;d think 10 times before doing that on any heavy motorcycle. But on the Africa Twin it was a breeze.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"heavy motorcycle\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-6.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - visordown</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to this are the <strong>rider ergos</strong>. You sit very upright in a neutral position. The upright stance helps you see ahead quite a long bit and is great for planning overtaking maneuvers. The neutral stance keeps your body in extreme comfort. There is no pressure on your knees and wrists (while braking). Your back is very straight. And the fixed wind screen does an amazing job of keeping your head and neck out of any major wind, thereby preventing a stiff neck or aching shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the rider ergos\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-7.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - doubleclutch</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:18px\">Now comes the trump card. </strong><em><strong>Or maybe, call it the ace.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The DCT gearbox</strong>. Now I am an avid biker and and I can totally relate to the view that it&#39;s Harakiri to ride an automatic bike because you don&#39;t feel connected etc. I felt the same way for the first 200 km of owning this machine. But take this from someone who has ridden a lot of bikes for a lot of miles, the DCT is sheer genius and kudos to HMSI for bringing it to India. Once you get the hang of it, it completely takes gear shifting out of the equation and reduces rider fatigue (both mental and physical) by a huge amount. Imagine riding for 5-6 hours to reach your destination only to be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic with another 30-50 km to go. We all know what that does to our wrists, knees and mind. With the DCT that&#39;s completely gone. <strong>There are 5 gear shifting modes in all (D, S1-3 and full manual)</strong>. There is also the option of installing a foot shifter that will act as a quickshifter and auto blipper in M mode. So for any kind of rider and riding&hellip;.<em>Honda has you covered</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"There are 5 gear shifting modes\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-8.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - visordown</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest surprise for me was how she handled in rain. While riding to Udaipur we faced incessant rain for about 350 km. And I was able to ride the bike as fast in the rain as I was in the dry. Now that is unusual. The tires gripped well. The engine and gearbox were super smooth and the suspension (though soft) gave a lot of riding confidence. I&#39;ve never ridden a bike so hard in the rain as I was able to ride the Africa Twin.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the first bike \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/african-twin-9.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - endeavorsuite</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I have not had a chance to ride her off-road (I&#39;m not much into that) but judging from how good she is onroad in our riding conditions. I can only imagine how good she will be off-road given the whole engineering is off-road biased. This is the first bike I&#39;ve owned that has egged me to try to learn to ride off-road. And I&#39;ve promised myself to have a proper go at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All in this is a marvellous bike</strong>. Actually all bikes are marvellous if you asked me :)....but then some bikes have a distinctive identity and purpose - this is one of them. Usually that identity and purpose makes them fit only for a niche audience (track, MX, offroad). That&rsquo;s where the Africa Twin breaks new ground. Her appeal is very wide &hellip;..anyone who yearns for wanderlust and loves to be on a motorcycle in India can get on her and go for a True Adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many decades ago Honda (then Hero Honda) had a very catchy slogan for one of their most successful products - <strong>&ldquo;Fill it, Shut it, Forget it&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 align=\"center\"><em>The Africa Twin is sort of the same philosophy - &ldquo;Go Anywhere, At Anytime, With Anyone&rdquo;. I think this is a great bike to have in India.</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">*****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The author is a complete &lsquo;Petroheadnerd&rsquo; and bike junkie and we, at <strong>BigBoyToyz</strong> credit and thank him for this amazing diary entry of his experiences with the Africa Twin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insta: petroheadnerd<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:Email: rishab.gulshan@gmail.com\">Email: rishab.gulshan@gmail.com</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>All humans have the gift of the 5 senses - sight, hear, touch, feel and smell. But a few of us, lucky enough to ride a motorcycle experience a unique and heightened state of these senses - the growl of the engine, the bark of the exhaust note, the smooth curves of metal and rich leather, the G forces we feel while accelerating and cornering and the addictive smell of fuel and rubber. Ask any serious biker and they will tell you - when you are on a motorcycle, each of your senses is at a higher level&hellip;.it&#39;s like a shot of adrenaline has been pumped into each of them&hellip;.that is what I call AdrenaSense - <em><strong>the state of being one with your motorcycle.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Bike</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ducati-multistrada-2.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motogeo</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many types of motorcycles made by many brands. The typical genres are - <strong>classics</strong>, <strong>roadsters</strong>, <strong>cruisers</strong>, <strong>tourers</strong>, <strong>off-road</strong> and <strong>sport</strong>. Each genre has a unique purpose. Then within each genre there are sub categories. For example tourers have <strong>sport tourers</strong> and <strong>adventure tourers</strong>. The former are made to go fast on tarmac while the latter can also be taken off the beaten track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example of a sport tourer is the <strong>Ducati Multistrada</strong> - an all purpose bike <em><strong>(multi strada means different roads)</strong></em> built by the Italian marque Ducati. But at its core, it is a sport tourer. The sort of bike that you can ride fast and hard for long (say 500 km) on open highways as well as winding backroads and mountains. Now there are many variants of the Multistrada - there is the <strong>Base</strong>, the <strong>S</strong> with its fancy electronic suspension, the <strong>Enduro</strong> with its off-road bias and then there is the <strong>Pikes</strong> Peak - the sportiest of them all. The Pikes Peak has about <strong>155 hp</strong> (that on a Ducati feel like 200) and about <strong>95 ft lb of torque</strong> delivered through an <strong>L twin engine with DVT</strong> (plan speak for a very powerful yet very smooth engine). With forged wheels, carbon fibre body parts, a slick <strong>ohlins suspension</strong> and a factory fitted termi end can, the Pikes Peak weighs about 20 kg less than the stock Multistrada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I picked one up a few months ago and have been absolutely mesmerised by it. I&#39;ve ridden a lot of bikes over the years but this one to me is absolutely the best sport tourer out there today. Now that is a tall claim to make. So why do I say so?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Trips</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ducati-multistrada-3.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - bauercdn</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve ridden my Pikes Peak for about 3000 km now. Included in that are 2 long trips - the first was a run up to the hills near Shimla and the other was a recent ride to Udaipur. In both cases I rode the bike for a good 400-500 km a day. The ride to Shimla was in the intense heat of June with non-existent roads once you crossed the Kalka bypass. The one to Udaipur was in intense rain with slightly better road conditions. In both cases I was riding with a few riding buddies of mine (4-5 guys in total)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>My Take on the Pikes Peak</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ducati-multistrada-4.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - totalmotorcycle</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>From the moment I rode the bike out of the showroom, I knew this was a special bike. But now that I&#39;ve done 3000+ km on it, I can give some perspective on why I feel that way</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First is its <strong>engine character</strong>. She barks like nothing out there. When you start a Ducati it almost sounds like an auto rickshaw, but when you twist the throttle under load, she has a bark like I&#39;ve never heard before. It&#39;s sort of a combination of the engine and exhaust sound that produces this bark. It&#39;s absolutely intoxicating. I found myself twisting the throttle all the time, even on a straight road, just to hear that bark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next is its <strong>pull</strong>. Even in touring mode, she pulls so hard that you feel your arms are going to get ripped off. This is the magic of a V twin and it&#39;s even more special in Ducati&#39;s L twin version. When you pull the throttle, the bark and the pull completely take over your senses and the magic of <em><strong>AdrenaSense</strong></em> starts !!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ducati-multistrada-5.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motogeo</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Then comes the <strong>handling</strong>. Its forged wheels (less weight) and Ohlins suspension shine here. It&#39;s extremely nimble and easy to corner. The <strong>electronic aids</strong> (IMU, 8 stage traction control, EBD etc) all work in tandem to keep it extremely safe in our road conditions. There are many times I&#39;ve opened the throttle a bit too much during a turn, sometimes even with sand or gravel or slush on the road, but she corners like she is on rails and the electronics safety net is incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then come the <strong>rider ergos</strong> and <strong>comfort</strong>. The seating position is clearly sport oriented but the ergos are so comfortable that you can easily ride for 400-500 km a day. The seat height is great. I&#39;m 6 feet tall and can easily put both my feet down with some flex in my knees. The short wind screen (also made from carbon fibre) does a great job of wind protection for all day comfort. The heat management on this bike is excellent. On a 45 degree summer day the temperature is very manageable even in stop and go traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>piece de resistance</strong> of the Pikes Peak has to be its suspension. The Ohlins unit (fully adjustable but not semi active &hellip;.as in you have to manually adjust it) is absolutely brilliant. It handles all our road conditions with ease always keeping the bike planted and the rider extremely comfortable. When you have to do this on a cruiser that will run at 100-120 km it&#39;s easy. But when you have to do this on a sport tourer that will run at 150 (sometimes even 200+) and corner hard, this task is very difficult to accomplish on Indian roads and the Pikes Peak really really shines here - it is the stand out feature of this bike, period !!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The one downside of the Pikes Peak are its forged wheels</strong> as they are prone to bends especially if you&#39;re riding hard (I already have a small sing in both my front and rear wheels).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ducati-multistrada-6.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - asphaltandrubber</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ducati-multistrada-7.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - visordown</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>So in a nutshell the Pikes Peak is a piece of art (every Ducati is) that barks and pulls like crazy, handles and corners like it&#39;s on rails, has all day riding comfort, a suspension setup that allows you to ride hard and fast on our broken roads and the most modern electronics to keep you safe while doing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For her sheer brilliance I&#39;d give her an AdrenaSense score of 9/10 and i can&#39;t wait to get back on her for a long ride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What she will do on the track is yet to be explored - but maybe after I do that she might just score the perfect 10!!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/ducati-multistrada-8.png\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - ducatistore</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">*****</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The author is a complete &lsquo;Petroheadnerd&rsquo; and bike junkie, which is apparent from his testimonial to the Multistrada.

For some it&#39;s cooking. For some it&#39;s gardening. For some it&#39;s playing music. For some it&#39;s adventure. For some it&#39;s travel. And then there are folks like me for whom the biggest source of AdrenaSense is something with an engine and either 2 or 4 wheels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two wheels or four, a motorcycle is man&#39;s greatest creation if you ask me. It is something very simple - an engine, a frame and 2 wheels&hellip;.so what is so great about it? Well for 99% of people in this world, NOTHING...it&#39;s just a cheap and reliable way to get from point A to point B. But for the remaining 1%, those who own and ride a large capacity motorcycle, it&#39;s a totally different story. <strong>For them, their Motorcycle is a symbol of Freedomâ€‹. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-3.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - asphaltandrubber</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The freedom to get away from the chores and stresses of daily life.<br />\r\nThe freedom to explore new places.<br />\r\nThe freedom to have new adventures.<br />\r\nThe freedom to be who you want, with who you want and do what you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And not just that, it&#39;s also an expression of who you are. It&#39;s a symbol of your identity, you passions, your hopes and dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-4.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - pinimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask any motorcycle enthusiast and they will tell you two things &ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. There is no greater joy than the joy of being on two wheels and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. #1 cannot be rationally or logically explained&hellip;.you either get it and become a biker for life, or don&#39;t get it and remain a bystander always wondering what if ????</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the same paradigm also applies to cars. For most of us cars are utility items. Comfortable and reliable things to get from point A to point B - get to office, take our kids to school or their friends place, head out to a mall or restaurant with the family etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-5.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - baffledcars</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>But then again there are the 1% for whom their cars are more, they are Spacesâ€‹ - spaces to hear the mechanical symphony of a delicious engine and exhaust, spaces to feel a fraction of the G forces that formula 1 racers and fighter pilots experience, spaces that make you feel like a million bucks by the way they look on the outside and their luxurious interiors on the inside, spaces to switch out from the external world and relax, spaces to enjoy your favourite music, spaces that can take you to exotic locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-6.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - walldevil</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask any carnut and they will also tell you two things &ndash;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Your car is an extension of who you are, and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. A supercar does not drive fast, it flies low.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-7.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - motoringexposure</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>AdrenaSense So why are the 1% of us addicted to motorcycles as symbols of Freedom and cars as Spaces. Well I think AdrenaSense has a lot to do with it. When I get on my motorcycle for a ride, be it the weekly Sunday ride or an outstation trip, I am super excited. I&#39;ve been riding for over 10 years now and I still find it difficult to contain my excitement and sleep well the night before I&#39;m heading for a bike trip. I get up early, put on my riding gear like a soldier would his/her uniform, shine my bike like it was the only thing I owned in this world, start the engine, let her warm up for a bit, put on my helmet, start playing some Coldplay through my scala, sit on her, pull in the clutch, engage first gear with a reassuring click and give it some throttle. Every single time I go through this sequence, it feels like I&#39;m incharge of a space craft and starting its a launch control sequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-8.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - i.pinimg</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>AdrenaSense starts to flow in my veins. I love it !!! Then the ride starts. I start slow and cautious. Zig zag on the road for a few hundred metres to warm up the tires. Get my body comfortable on the bike. And then I start to push her. The revs start climbing. The mechanical symphony of the engine and exhaust start building. The G forces start to gain strength. The smell of fuel, rubber and fumes mixed with the crisp and cool morning air starts to seep in. AdrenaSense starts to take over every part of my mind and body. I love it !!! Finally I hit the open road. The bike is fully warmed up. My mind and body are one with her. Paradise is playing on the scala. Finally It&#39;s time to have some fun. I gun the throttle and she launches like a rocket. The sound of the engine and exhaust is intoxicating now. I constantly shortshift to make the most of both the sound and the G forces at play. I start cutting through traffic like I was playing a video game. Every part of my body is connected to the bike and my brain is the control centre. Now AdrenaSense has taken over and I&#39;m it&#39;s humble slave. The next few hours are for me. I love it !!!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-9.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - asphaltandrubber</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The same happens to me everytime I get into a supercar. But it&#39;s different. A motorcycle is minimalist. The damn engine is under you and its 2 wheels are a hyper extension of your body. You are 30-40% of the combined system. A supercar is very different. There is a whole different sense of drama in a super car. The way the steering feels in your hand, the way the dash lights up, the way the seat hugs you into place, the way the gearstick or paddleshifters feel in your hand, the fact that you can play your favourite music on a pretty awesome sound system, that you are surrounded by exotic materials like carbon fibre, brushed aluminium, alcantara, rich nappa leather adds to the sense of occaision and drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/lamborghini-reventon-10.jpg\" /> <span class=\"imgRef\">source - 4.bp.blogspot</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s its own thing and you are just one cog in the wheel. But when you start her up and head out, the way AdrenaSense starts to take control of your body is no different from a motorcycle - atleast for me. I love it !!! This is why the 1% of us love our motorcycles and cars. It&#39;s AdrenaSense. Everytime we think or talk about them, look at their picture, walk past them, clean and polish them, install an accessory, take them for service and most importantly ride and drive them, it&#39;s at play with varying intensities. It forms a sort of mystical bond between our physical bodies and these inanimate mechanical objects where they become an integral part of our very existence. Our joys and sorrows, our hopes and dreams, our passion and creativity, our friends and families. That&#39;s when you know you are a PetroHeadNerd and that AdrenaSense flows in your veins. I certainly am one and know many others. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to write about my experiences of these magical machines and am dedicating this blog to that. I will keep writing small pieces and hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:20px\">To all the PetroHeadNerds out there, may your AdrenaSense be with you !!!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The writer is as defined by his Insta id. We @BBT extend our heartiest thanks to him for this wonderful description of his affair with his mean machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insta: petroheadnerd</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

prestige keeping in mind a huge fan following.</p>\r\n<p>If we talk about the technical specifications of the car, it will simply leave you spellbound because this car has a naturally aspirated V10 high revving engine and if the sound from the exhausts remind you of a <a href=\"/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> then don&rsquo;t be surprised.</p>\r\n<p><em>The heart is a 5.2-litre petrol motor that gains additional 20bhp in comparison to the R8 Plus so as a result the 0-100Kmph timing is of 3.4 seconds and top speed is pegged at 320 km/hr</em>.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"5-maxresdefault\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/5-maxresdefault.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - ytimg</span></div>\r\n<p>So this reflects the sportiness along with passion &amp; enthusiasm to own and drive a supercar in town.

Look at where we are now! Home!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, there is nothing better than your car as it bring to you ton load of happiness and whether or not you control who lives in your home, you control who sits in your car!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though not a fan of luxury, but music has been something I&rsquo;ve never compromised with and so comes the speakers.<br />\r\nThe overpriced priceless ones, begging for you to root for a petrol version instead of using LPG cylinder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, they surely bring a sigh of relief from the everyday life, be it boyfriend troubles or office overload, parents drooling or ambitions spilling, existential crisis or quintessential breakthroughs, everything is downpour when it comes to the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of them are spin offs of each other, does it really matter?<br />\r\nEven music nowadays follow the similar trend.<br />\r\nSo, without wasting much time, let&rsquo;s get on with the list of best speakers for your car!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Kicker DS65 2-Way Car Speakers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This speakers come at a handy cost of 5538/- in India. The best part about this one is the extensively used round shaped coil that produces clean and crisp sound. Although bass may not be the best of them all but when we talk about medium and high pitched notes, this just takes the cake.<br />\r\nPair them up with two subwoofers, you&rsquo;ll find yourself on the stairway to heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Infinity Reference 6032CF 2-Way Car Speakers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Does it look like anything to you?</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Infinity Reference 6032CF 2-Way Car Speakers\" src=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/images/blogs/best-car-speakers-2.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - mazale.in</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>To you, it may not! But, trust me to some people this is madness.<br />\r\nIt costs you around 15k in India, but if we go by the people&rsquo;s verdict, it&rsquo;s worth this much. The best part about them is that they are prone to customization, you can tweak the direction of central tweeter, even Decibel output that you&rsquo;re looking at and the conical area is not for showbiz only, it facilitates the whole body to produce eclectic sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>tweak the direction of central tweeter, even Decibel output that you&rsquo;re looking at and the conical area is not for showbiz only, it facilitates the whole body to produce eclectic sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, go with them only if you have a lot of black money as they necessarily look good with the high-end brands of the likes of <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/jaguar\" target=\"_blank\">Jaguar</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Alpine SPS-610C-2 Way Car Speakers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is just what was expected from Alpine, a listener&rsquo;s delight.<br />\r\nWith a moderate budget of 8k, these speakers bring out the best vocals in mid or high pitch zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grills that come with them are sold separately but you shouldn&rsquo;t be worried about them when compared to the quality you are getting.<br />\r\nWhen you put them up with S type subwoofers, you officially get bestowed upon the responsibility of playing Punjabi songs, now all you need is an <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/audi\" target=\"_blank\">Audi</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>JBL GT 0628 2-Way Car Speakers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s JBL! Do I need to say more?<br />\r\nThis beauty comes at a refined cost of 7K and is the best buy according to me at this range.<br />\r\nTechnically speaking, these low impedance speakers get you the best possible sound according to all the electronic fragiles.<br />\r\nSuggested a buy in case you are a JBL fanatic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jaras JJ 2646 3-Way Car Speakers</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"Jaras JJ 2646 3-Way Car Speakers\" src=\"https://bigboytoyz.com/images/blogs/best-car-speakers-3.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - mazale.in</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Affordable, good looking and brilliant.<br />\r\nThese key features define this speaker! Although, the overall impact may not be as refined as the above ones but at a cost of 6k, what more can you ask? The Cobalt blue color is the best one yet when it comes to speakers.<br />\r\nWhen they light up, they set up the whole house on fire.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

In India everybody has overcome the American dynasty and been using the right hand drive from ages.<br />\r\nOk, I bet it, but this shit is Japanese, motherf*****.<br />\r\n<em>I agree, you got me there!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, now that I&rsquo;ve got your full attention, I&rsquo;m pleased to tell you that I acquired this from a Washington national, who himself bought it from a guy hailing from Canada, who in turn imported it from Japan.<br />\r\n<em>Woah, that sounds like a lot of work dude!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t even begin to speak about the things I have to do to cope up with the regular struggle of driving!<br />\r\nThough I don&rsquo;t want to hear about it, but I know that you&rsquo;re gonna tell me anyway!<br />\r\nHaha, now you got me there fella!<br />\r\n<em>I know.</em><br />\r\nSo, coming back at it, due to the beauty being right handed, it offers a lot of grotesque tasks on the American road, most of them being attributed to the suspension being stiff, the turbo is boosting bina wajah all the time, and the steering is tight like a lady&rsquo;s attitude.<br />\r\n(She is my baby, to itna to banta hi hai na, olelelolai!)<br />\r\n<em>Why did you buy it then?</em><br />\r\nWell, she looked great in my school&rsquo;s parking lot, her hot racy attire helped a lot with the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/nissan-skyline-gta-t-2.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - pop.h-cdn</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Isn&rsquo;t it illegal to drive with right handed drive according to US laws?</em><br />\r\nYes it definitely is, but there is a relaxation for the adults. (25+ years can make the cars go round, I honestly don&rsquo;t know why but it sometimes gets treated as antique.)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/nissan-skyline-gta-t-3.png\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - pop.h-cdn</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>So, what now?</em><br />\r\nI&rsquo;m gonna ride it around for awhile and see how things are with it, I&rsquo;m not thinking of selling it to any <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">used car dealer</a>, as my baby is mine and you just don&rsquo;t give it to anybody else, even to the likes of BBT that have many such feathers in its cap.

Launched over a decade ago and currently in its 3rd generation, it's one of the largest selling supercars in the world because of its supercarish practicality (now that term is an oxymoron, but I will explain a bit later).</p>\r\n<p><br />I got to sample a gen 2 <a href=\"/used/audi/2013-used-audi-r8-detail\">Audi R8 V10</a> Spyder for a few days and was blown away by its razor sharp looks, mind numbing engine and exhaust note, and overall practicality. Being a spyder, the car almost had 2 personalities - one with the top on and one with the top off.</p>\r\n<h2>The Engine</h2>\r\n<p>The V10 variant of the R8 comes with a 10 cylinder longitudinal v engine. The engine is the same unit that powered the previous gen Lamborghini Gallardo and powers the current gen Lamborghini Hurracan. It produces nearly 550 HP of power and 500 NM of torque. So crazy is the power delivery of this engine, that it propels the car like a rocket ship and you have to hang on for dear life. But the standout feature of the engine has to be it's deep and throaty sound. It's a modern day mechanical orchestra that rises to a menacingly intoxicating howl as the engine reaches its redline of 8000+ rpm. The engine sits just behind you and so the sound is served fresh out of the oven. Trust me, this car is worth buying just for the engine. Period !</p>\r\n<h2>The Transmission</h2>\r\n<p>The variant I drove had the 6 speed automated mechanical R tronic gearbox. Now this has been called the Achilles heels of the previous gen R8. It's a single clutch automated manual gearbox. So the shifts are not as fast or smooth as a dual clutch unit. But you have to learn the operate the gearbox to unleash its potential. You have to lift your foot off the throttle (like you would in a regular manual) to allow the gear to change swiftly. Once you train your mind and legs to operate the unit properly, it's a very fun gearbox to play with, especially in S mode with the paddle shifts. The &ldquo;pop paps&rdquo; it produces on upshifts and downshifts from that glorious exhaust note have to be heard to believed. They are truly addictive.</p>\r\n<h2>Suspension, Handling and Ride Quality</h2>\r\n<p>The R8 is designed to be a practical supercar. One that you can theoretically use everyday. So the suspension setup is on the softer side by supercar standards. What this translates into in the real world is a sublime ride quality. This is one supercar that you can actually drive for hours without any discomfort to your body.</p>\r\n<p><br />It comes with Audi&rsquo;s renowned Quattro all wheel drive system in its highest state of tune. So while it does not have the finesse and and playfulness of a rear wheel drive car, it has incredible balance due to the engine being mid mounted and it corners like it's on rails thanks to the Quattro system. Even in inclement weather and on our poor road surfaces, the R8 has incredible balance and cornering ability. I can only imagine what she will be like on a race track.</p>\r\n<h2>In Summary</h2>\r\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"/audi\">Audi</a></strong> R8 Spyder is the everyday supercar with an engine straight out of supercar rock n roll hall of fame, the looks of an Italian supermodel and the practicality of a daily driver.</p>\r\n<p><br />What I don't like is the ground clearance and the slightly wobbly front brakes under heavy load.<br />With the top down it has the ability to take you to a different level - you don't feel that you are driving fast, you feel like you are flying low. It's truly magical !!</p>\r\n<p><strong>AdrenaSense Score - 8/10</strong></p>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>The Starship Enterprise is perhaps the most iconic superstar machine of all time. I grew up watching it in the epic Star Trek show and till day am a huge fanboy of its magnificent though quirky looks, it&#39;s 31st-century technology and it&#39;s galaxy-hopping prowess. I always wondered if there was a car that would best describe this fictional character. Then I got to spend some time with <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/ferrari\">a Ferrari FF</a> and there was my answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is the Ferrari FF?</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Ferarri FF\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-most-practical-car-made-by-ferrari-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The most practical car made by Ferrari!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe FF is Ferrari&#39;s previous generation 12 cylinder, 4 seater (yes a 4 seater Ferrari), all wheel drive Grand Tourer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe engine is a 12 cylinder naturally aspirated monster that punches out 650 HP of power with about 700 NM of torque. It&#39;s mated to a 7&nbsp;speed rapidly shifting dual clutch gearbox. It has a trick transmission system that is essentially rear wheel biased but it has a small 2 gear unit mounted in front of the engine that can transmit about 30% of the engine&#39;s power to the front wheels under low traction conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferrari makes some of the most beautiful and desirable cars in the world. Their cars are like supermodels - sharp, chiseled and chic. The FF I think is one their most beautiful creations. The long swooping hood hiding the massive V12 engine and the razor-sharp L shaped front head lights are its signature design cues. The overall profile is a bit estate-like. A lot of Ferrari lovers hate it, but I seemed to like it. It&#39;s a bit quirky like it&#39;s metaphorical twin, the Starship Enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside it has 4 proper adult seats. The body shape is a 2 door coupe, so to access the rear seats you have to get in from the front door, but they are genuinely large seats that can comfortably seat 2 adults. I&#39;ve done a 500 km trip in this car with 2 adults sitting in the back and they had the time of their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interiors are very very very special. This specific car had chocolate brown leather, with contrast yellow stitching and carbon fiber everywhere. The whole interior feels like you are sitting in a fighter jet. The seats are snug, the dash is fully digital with super cool displays, the steering feels like you are holding on to a race car and has these super cool series of led lights on its top section that light up as the revs climb, asking you to upshift. Then there are these two giant carbon fiber paddle shifters (fixed to the steering column) to change gears. I used to get goosebumps just getting into the car everytime. She certainly made me feel like Captain Kirk, ready to engage the Starship Enterprise</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What&#39;s it like to drive a Ferrari for the first time in your life?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Ferarri FF\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-most-practical-car-made-by-ferrari-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Absolutely glorious!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFerrari is automotive royalty. It&#39;s the most desirable brand in any auto enthusiast&#39;s wish list. I have dreamt of sitting in one ever since I was a kid, so imagine my excitement when I had the opportunity to spend a few days with a real, modern, V 12 Ferrari. I was overjoyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first time I went for a drive in it, I was nervous and excited like I was on my first date (with my now lovely wife). I could not contain the excitement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nStep 1 - I unlock the car and get in. I adjust the seats to my comfort. Run my hands around the chunky and sporty steering wheel. I take a deep breath...for godsakes I am actually going to drive a Ferrari.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nStep 2 - I turn the key and push the red &quot;start engine&quot; button on the steering wheel. The big V 12 comes to life with the most incredible sound I&#39;ve ever heard. I wait for her to warm up just a bit and then rev her to 4-5 thousand rpm and the sound of the naturally aspirated engine engulfs the whole cabin. Trust me, if you like cars you should be willing to give up an arm and a leg just to hear the symphony of this mechanical wonder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nStep 3 - I engage first gear and she starts to move. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m driving a Ferrari. I am on a wide open road, but take it very easy for the first 15-20 min just trying to get a hang of the vehicle. I can stop giggling inside my head. I&#39;m reminded of Pink Floyd&#39;s Brain Damage and the laughing soundtrack in that video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nStep 4 - I&#39;ve now been driving her for 20-25 minutes. I&#39;ve got the general hang of things and I decide that it&#39;s time to realize item #1 on my bucket list - WOT in a V 12 Ferrari. I go for it and what happens next is indescribable in words. I feel like I&#39;ve been slapped on my backside by Thor&#39;s hammer and am going to be launched into outer space. The audio coming from the screaming engine and exhaust has completely taken over. My hands are holding on to the steering wheel for dear life and before I realize, I&#39;ve now attained the fastest speed I&#39;ve ever done in any car or bike. I am absolutely overwhelmed by this experience. It&#39;s something that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I&#39;m sure this is how Captain Kirk felt, the first time he engaged warp drive on the Starship Enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What&#39;s it like to live with the FF?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Like you are on top of the world!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Ferarri FF\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-most-practical-car-made-by-ferrari-4.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>I had this car for a few days and did a lot of driving in that time. I took my wife and kiddo for a 300 km+ drive. I went for a 500 km+ run with a few of my buddies. And I did a lot of city and periphery driving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This car is sheer genius. The has a complete Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality. Drive her softly and she moves like any large sedan would. The fueling is smooth, the ride quality is compliant, the gear shifts are seamless. She has comfortable seating for 4 adults with adequate luggage space. The ride height is decent - I rarely scraped her anywhere. The sound system is pretty decent. There are no super car tantrums. But even in this sedate state, there is supercar drama. The nice weighty feeling of the steering. The gentle roar of the exhaust. The crisp &quot;pop-paps&quot; of the gear shifts. Even when you&#39;re driving in city traffic at 50-60 KMPH, there is something magical about her. AdrenaSense starts to flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then with a few clicks of a switch on the steering wheel (called the manetteno) she transforms into Mr Hyde. Turn the gearbox into full manual mode, give it some gas and she transforms into a formula 1 car. The sound, the feedback from the steering, the quick shifting of the gears, the manic engine and exhaust noise, the insane g forces on your body completely engulf you. That you are experiencing all this in a 4 seater, 4 wheel drive road going production car, is almost impossible to fathom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have driven a lot of supercars - BMW Ms, Mercedes AMGs, Porsches, Audi RSs, Maseratis, Aston Martins, Lamborghinis and then the one Ferrari. I now understand what they mean when they say Ferrari is at the top of the food chain. She is as iconic a brand in real life as the USS Enterprise is on reel life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months later, I had the opportunity to visit the Ferrari museum in Maranello (I will write a seperate blog about that). One of the most unique places there was their F1 museum. It was a circular room with 10 generations of F1 displayed on one side, every F1 champion who drove with Ferrari on the other side and on top were displayed in a 360 degree view all their F1 trophies. I stood there for 15 minutes, in shock and awe. This is what commitment to excellence means. And that racing DNA lives in every road going Ferrari. No words or pictures can describe it. You have to experience it for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Ferarri FF\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/the-most-practical-car-made-by-ferrari-5.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>AdrenaSense score - 1000/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insta - petroheadnerd</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email - <a href=\"mailto:rishab.gulshan@gmail.com\">Email - rishab.gulshan@gmail.com</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<p>I&#39;ve been up since 5am. It&#39;s now 11 pm. To say it has been a crazy day is an understatement. 16 hours of non stop conference calls and meetings as we prepare for an important client meeting the next day. Endless debates, a hundred different opinions, and unfettered emotions all around. Little food, even lesser fresh air and an overdose of caffeine over the day. It&#39;s now day 4 of this drill. I&#39;ve been at it since Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\">My head is spinning @ a million miles per minute. My eyes are burning harder than a wild forest fire. My neck and back are stiffer than a concrete wall. Fatigue - mental, physical and emotional has set it. And tomorrow is the big day when I need to be at my best. It&#39;s time to go home to get a few hours of sleep. God knows what will happen. I&#39;m simply exhausted !!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I get down to the car park. There she is, standing unassumingly in the corner. As I approach her, the sheer gracefulness and elegance of the Scandinavian design brings a smile to my face. As I gently touch the door handle and she unlocks. The iconic Thor&#39;s Hammer DRLs appear and the stunning interior lights up. There is a certain sense of occasion. I am looking forward to the next 45 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Interiors</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Volvo S90\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/numb-in-the-volvo-s90-2.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\">I&#39;ve been in a few Volvos before and while very functional, their interiors were nothing to write home about. But these new generation Volvos are a completely different ballgame. The combination of soft Napa leather, wood and brushed aluminum works like magic and the overall quality and finish of the interior is a league above (think Bentley and Porsche).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I turn the start knob, a nice block of brushed aluminum placed right below your left hand, and she purrs to life. The dash is an all digital affair with colors and fonts that are exceptionally detailed and smooth on the eye. I&#39;ve seen a few current gen Audi all digital dashes (R8, TT, A4 etc) and while they are a technical marvel, I personally found them very cluttered and distracting. I prefer <a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/volvo\">the Volvo</a> approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I then turn my attention to the iPad placed in the centre of the car - yes there is an ipad there !! There is this large touchscreen panel which is the central nervous system of this car. Practically everything is controlled from there. And again the implementation is just awesome. The fonts are detailed and beautiful, the touchscreen response is quick and the system never hangs. Volvo is showing the way here - in a world when touchscreen smartphones and tablets are omnipresent, this is how a car&#39;s central console should look and function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I start my playlist. It&#39;s playing on my iPad which at this point is sitting in my office bag on the rear seat. It picks up the playlist right where it left in the morning. Floyd is playing. I put her into drive and take off.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Drive</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The S90 is powered by a 2 liter diesel motor putting about 200 bhp and 400 nm of torque. It&#39;s a very refined motor where they have used some very clever engineering to virtually eliminate any turbo lag. She&#39;s no rocketship, but takes off with a very potent force and gets to triple digit speeds very quickly. The gearbox is an 8 speed automatic unit, that shifts seamlessly without you ever noticing the shifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This car is not about power and thrills. This car is about extreme refinement. There is hardly any engine or road noise that makes it to the cabin. The ride quality is incredibly plush - there is a trick setup where the front suspension is a conventional setup but the rear suspension is an air set up. Overall the set up works really well for our Indian roads. She just glides over everything with ease and comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a bunch of driving modes (eco, comfort and dynamic). Eco is too dull. Dynamic sharpens up the throttle and steering response and in my opinion does not suit this car. Comfort is the right mode and I mostly drive in that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Features Galore</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Volvo is really upping the ante here. They have a beautiful exterior design, an awesome interior, a next gen instrument console but the party does not stop there. The list is endless and I cannot do justice to it here. Lane departure assist, self parking assist, automated emergency braking are some of the more innovative safety and convenience features it has. These again seem next gen in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Sound System</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the sound system\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/numb-in-the-volvo-s90-3.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The S90 in India only comes in one trim that&#39;s fully loaded. It has a lot of stuff, but in addition to the top quality interior, the other standout feature has to be the Bower and Wilkins sound system. It is just mindblowing. I&#39;m no audiophile, but I love listening to music while driving A LOT and this has to be one of the best setups I&#39;ve heard, if not the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a lot of software gadgetry with the sound system - different modes, tone settings, equaliser settings etc etc ....and the initiated can use all that to get the most of out this system, but for me play it in any mode and it&#39;s just divine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Sum of All Parts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.bigboytoyz.com/volvo/volvo-s90\">S90</a></strong> is really a car where the sum of all parts come together to create something unique. The high quality interior, the sublime ride quality, the seamless powertrain, the awe-inspiring sound system - all work like the Fantastic Four superheroes to make this something special. Don&#39;t take my word for it. Take a leisurely testdrive at your convenience and check for yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m now cruising on the highway. There is the usual Gurgaon late night truck and taxi traffic. I&#39;m just cruising at 80-90. It seems effortless. The soft leather and plush ride quality have cocooned me and it feels like I&#39;m getting a deep tissue massage. The sound system is at its best. I&#39;m playing it in concert mode and it feels like the singers are right there in front of me (okay I&#39;m exaggerating a bit, but you get the point). Suddenly in 15-20 minutes, I&#39;m in a totally different state of mind. I feel relaxed, energetic and optimistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Floyd is now in full swing and Comfortably Numb is playing. It&#39;s like the S90 is telling me...&quot;take it easy kiddo, you will do just fine tomorrow&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"the Volvo S90\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/numb-in-the-volvo-s90-4.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>AdrenaSense score - 7/10</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

  "postcontent": "<div class=\"blogdetailcont\">\r\n<h2>What is a sport tourer for India?</h2>\r\n<p>For me it's an automobile that blends the essential qualities of a sports car with that of a long distance tourer and works in the Indian context. It must have a strong and thrilling engine. It must handle well. It should have strong brakes. It should sound awesome. It should have adequate ground clearance. It should have a good sound system. It should be comfortable enough to drive 10-12 hours a day. It should look good. It should be compact enough to cut through traffic on our congested highways. It should make you feel special every time you get in. It should have comfortable seating for 4 with some decent luggage capacity. It should make you smile every time you start it up. It should fill your heart with joy every time you take it for a spin. It should make you grin from ear to ear every time you put your foot down.</p>\r\n<p>This may seem like an impossible list for one vehicle to check off. I've been driving sports cars for years now. I must say there are very few cars that can meet even 50% or 75% of these qualities, especially for our Indian conditions.</p>\r\n<p>My previous top pick for this was <a href=\"/used/mercedes-benz/2012-used-mercedes-c63-amg-detail\">the Mercedes C63 AMG</a> or maybe <a href=\"/used/bmw/2015-used-bmw-m4-coupe-detail\">the BMW M4</a>. But I think I've found a vehicle that beats both of them when you consider all these qualities and that is <a href=\"/used/mercedes-benz/2015-used-mercedes-benz-gla-45-amg-detail\">the Mercedes GLA 45 AMG</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I've just driven over 1000 km in this beauty over the past 3 days. We went up to Almora In UP. The roads were terrible - 80% undivided highway broken all over. The traffic was insane - trucks, cars, bikes, cycles, bullock carts, hand carts and people walking all over the place. Both these factors don't make for an interesting and enjoyable road trip. But the AMG turned out to the proverbial \"rabbit out of the hat\" and turned what would have been endless misery into what become one of the most enjoyable drives I've had in India.</p>\r\n<p>I will keep this blog simple. I will describe what I loved about the car and what I did not like.</p>\r\n<h2>What I loved</h2>\r\n<p><strong>#1. The engine - </strong><a href=\"/used/mercedes-benz/2015-used-mercedes-benz-gla-45-amg-detail\">the GLA 45 AMG</a> is powered by the most powerful production 2 liter engine in the world. It's a turbocharged 4 cylinder motor that puts out about 360 hp and 450 nm of torque. But the most amazing thing is the way it puts out the power. There is absolutely no turbo lag and put your foot on the throttle and she darts forward like a little go kart. The acceleration is absolutely insane and she keeps reviving to an amazing 6500 rpms, which is phenomenal for a turbo charged motor. The thrill of this engine is amazing regardless of pushing it on a highway or darting through traffic in the city. The power is just instant and insane. This has to be one of the most thrilling engines ever produced - and that it's a 2 liter engine is just incredible. Take a bow the engineering team at AMG for producing such a thrilling low capacity motor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>#2 The noises -</strong> yes, she makes plenty of incredible noises. First is the glorious rumble of that exhaust. Being a blown motor the engine almost does not make any noise, but the exhaust more than compensates for that. From a cold start to when you push your foot down (especially in sport mode), the exhaust serves up the most delicious sound ever and will fill your ears and heart with joy. Then there are the pops and crackles. They appear when you upshift with your foot on the accelerator or downshift under hard braking and boy are they glorious. It always sounds like a bunch of shotguns were fired. I first experienced pops and crackles in an Audi RS5 a few years ago. But trust me, the AMG engineers have taken it to another level. I kept accelerating, up shifting, braking and downshifting again and again, like you hear your favorite song on repeat, just to hear those pops and crackles. But wait, that's not enough. There is a third incredible noise this machine produces and that's from the blow off valve of the turbo. Every time you press down hard on the accelerator and then take your foot off, there is this awesome whistling sound you hear. It sounds very similar to the whistle of a supercharger but it's actually coming from the turbo. It a small detail but I feel the engineers at AMG have deliberately gone the extra bit to enhance this sound. It's a wonderful little nerdy type of detail that pertroheads like me will just love.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><video width=\"860\" height=\"520\" controls=\"controls\"><source src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/Mercedes-gla.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> <source src=\"movie.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\" />Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div>\r\n<p><strong>#3. Handling -</strong> technically the GLA 45 AMG is a cross over. So the handling should be compromised. And to some extent it is. But on an absolute level, the handling is incredible for our roads. The suspension is very well tuned. It's firm to give it that taught sports car character, but the damping is brilliant so you don't feel the harshness of our bumpy roads. It's fitted with 19 inch wheels and 235/35 profile tyres that are awesome. It comes with the fourmatic all-wheel drive system that can send as much as 50% power to the rear wheels under load. It has an amazing steering that is electrically assisted but still has that heavy feel of a sports car steering and is very direct. These 4 aspects combine to deliver exceptional handling on our bumpy and undulating roads. She moves like she is on rails and turns on a time. I was pushing her post 200 kmph on UP highways that has lots of crevices made by overloaded trucks, and she was leaping ahead like a panther with amazing levels of stability. I also got a chance to push her in the twisties a fair bit and she came up right on top. She had minimal body roll (very surprising for a cross over) and danced from side to side like a true blooded sports car would. I was incredibly impressed and can't wait to push her on a track. If you're a sport car enthusiast, I dare you to try this vehicle and not come out really impressed with how she handles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>#4. Looks and interior - </strong>these are always subjective, but I instantly fell in love with the GLA 45 AMG on these aspects. It's a beautifully designed and styled car. I love the aggressive stance that looks like a sprinter about to start a 100 meter dash. I love the arched fenders, especially the rear ones. I love the 19 inch wheels that completely fill up the wheel arches. I love the sporty front grill and the quad exhaust vents at the rear. I the roof spoiler.<br />The interior is even more impressive. First is the steering wheel. I always believed that Porsche used to make the best steering wheels, but the new ones in the AMG are next level. It feels incredible to hold in the hand. Is beautiful contoured in the right places. Has Alcantara on the sides (where you will hold it most of the times) to maximize grip. And then it's has beautiful contrast red stitching for that extra special effect. Next are the seats. They are made by Recaro (specialists in racing seats). They look incredibly sporty and act the part too. They are well bolstered around the thighs and torso with adjustable levels so that you can fine tune the bolstering. When done right they absolutely hug you which makes pushing the car in corners even more special. Then is the dash. It's a proper 2 circle set up with a speedometer and a rev counter with a digital display in the center. The counter look stunning especially at night with the red needles. The digital console is very crisp and high res and can display all sorts of information. It's also highly customizable. Then there is the central display. It looks like a iPad mini and is very sharp and crisp. The command system is also very easy and intuitive to use. The rest of the interior is also very high quality and ultra special combining black, grey and red to create the ultimate sporty ambience. The piece de resistance of the interior has to be the red colored seat belts that come standard. They create an incredible contrast against the black theme of the interior and are a sport car lovers delight. This has to be one of the most exciting interiors I've experienced in a car - period. Every time I enter the car, I feel delighted like a little child. And that's a pretty extraordinary thing to achieve. Kudos Mercedes !!</p>\r\n<p><strong>#5. Practicality -</strong> this is where this vehicle impressed me the most. It has adequate seating for 4 adults. You can carry enough luggage for a 3-4 day trip. The ground clearance is amazing. It did not scrape the ground even once. One of the paces we stayed at had a very treacherous climb to get to. It was a broken road with a lot of stones and a steep incline for almost 3-4 km and she handled it without a hitch. I dare you to find me another sports car / cross over that can do this. The sound system is amazing. It's has 2 moon roofs that make the cabin feel spacious and airy, one of which also doubles up as a sun roof. The ride quality is very well balanced. It's stiff enough to not compromise handling and soft enough to not send shudders up your spine every time you hit a bump - this balance of the ride quality is very very difficult to achieve especially in a country like India and AMG has done a stellar job with it.</p>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/mercedes-gla-45-amg-2.png\" /></div>\r\n<p>What I did not like</p>\r\n<p>Well there is only 1 thing. There are a lot of noises that creep into the interior. The car I have has done only about 3000 km but has all sorts of noises and rattles in the interior. Now I understand that being a sport oriented vehicle the suspension is on the firmer side and given our bad roads, this will mean lots of rattles. But I do feel that MB can go the extra bit to put more damping materials to take care of this. The rattles really come in the way of what is otherwise an incredible soundtrack and spoil the party. Maybe a visit to the workshop can get this issue addressed.</p>\r\n<h2>In summary</h2>\r\n<p>What can I say. I am a sports car enthusiast who loves to drive long distances in India. And I can say with confidence that the GLA 45 AMG is going to my my preferred weapon of choice for this. She is incredible to drive long distances. At the same time she is very practical for the city. All this with those incredible looks and extra special interior. If you have the spirit of touring in you. If you like to push your car. If you like the thrill of a twisty and windy road. If you can afford her - this is the automobile you should opt for.<br />I have always felt that among the Germans, BMW used to make the best driving machines. Machines that put the \"driver\" first and did everything to get your AdrenaSense going. I am increasingly of the view that <strong><a href=\"/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a></strong> and AMG are coming to the party and producing some of the most special \"driver\" focused automobiles out there. The GLA 45 AMG is a perfect example of that - thrilling, special and (relatively) affordable for the sport car enthusiast who loves to drive long distance in India. And for that Mercedes and AMG, I salute you from my heart !!!</p>\r\n</div>",

Our destination back was a mere 500m and it being pitch dark, we were very apprehensive and prayed for a miracle to happen and indeed it did.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"The All New Audi A6 Matrix \" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/images/cache/audi-a6-matrix-2.jpg\" /><span class=\"imgRef\">source - rushlane</span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What are those beautiful rays of light, meaning to say that I can see two points of supply focusing closely and it is hurriedly moving towards our direction&rdquo;!<br />\r\n&ldquo;Ah!

So nice of a stranger to offer help and from being a mere acquaintance to becoming the best of buddies was definitely not away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Good Samaritan not only took us back to the resort but offered us that&nbsp;something extra which&nbsp;came out of the blues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the motoring genes in us surely knows how to develop a rapport on the very first instance!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can sense that you are true car aficionados the way the A6 is being admired by you all.

Before you <a href=\"/our-showroom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>buy an exotic luxury car</strong></a>, you should find out whether there is an authorised service centre available near you or in your city and whether the spare parts of the car are readily available.<br />It is of no use buying an expensive car and keeping it in the garage if something goes wrong because of the unavailability or shortage of the spare parts for the car in the market.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Steps to follow when buying a used luxury car</strong></p>\r\n<h2>Conduct a Full Diagnostic Check</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/luxury-car-buying-advice-7.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>A high-end car is packed with sensors and top-of-the-line electronics that make the car run smoothly. When you are contemplating of buying a used luxury car, then you should do a full diagnostic check.<br />These checks are very easy to conduct through a handheld computer that is plugged into a car system.

Therefore, before you agree to buy a used luxury car model, you should check its central command system. Use all the functions of the central command system to see whether they are performing as per their design and functionality.<br />If you find any major issue in any of the features, you should re-think over your decision of purchasing that model, because it would cost you a large sum of money to rectify any issues relating to the command system of the car.</p>\r\n<h2>Look For Any Modifications</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/luxury-car-buying-advice-9.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>It is preferable to avoid purchasing a car that has been modified earlier by its previous owner. The modification could be in the form of adding a turbocharged engine, changing the engine management system, using bigger tyres or some changes in the suspension system.<br />A luxury car is a precise piece of machinery where every component is designed to give you optimum performance. Any modification that alters that design or performance of the car can hurt its structural integrity as well as its long-term performance.</p>\r\n<h2>Battery &amp; Tyres</h2>\r\n<div class=\"blogImg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/luxury-car-buying-advice-10.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>The battery and the tyres of a super luxury car cost a lot of money. Therefore, before you buy the car, look at their conditions carefully and check for their remaining lifespan and durability.</p>\r\n<h2>Try Every Features &amp; Look for any Additional Cost</h2>\r\n<p>You should try out all the features of the car to see that they are operating perfectly. You should also look for the additional costs that you may incur when you are buying a premium car. These costs include spare parts, amount of fuel it guzzles, servicing charges, and many more.</p>\r\n</div>",

  "postcontent": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The astonishment you will gift yourself when the Used Mercedes will touch your heart gently and let you explore most places with the least of expenses. The auto industry is changing rapidly and car prices are only going up. To highlight, new cars are getting costlier each year, making them a very high-value purchase for the common man. And quite ironically if you look into the market, the average lifespan of a luxury car is going down despite the steady rise in prices, which brings in good news for potential used car buyers. And it is here. Thanks to the building dealers in the country more and more modern cars are now entering the used car market, which makes it easy for you to make a good buy without having to bust your wallet. A used car makes more sense for first-time buyers upgrading from two-wheelers or public transportation, or for that matter, someone looking to buy a second set of wheels in the family and for those reasons, BIG BOY TOYZ comes into play.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is true when I say that, all it takes is less than a minute for a new car, straight out from a showroom, to lose 8-10% of its purchase price as it enters used car territory. Going for a used purchase means you have to pay a lot less than the original value of the car, subject to the year of manufacture and kilometers traveled, which means you can save some serious money. If you are buying a <a href=\"/buy-used-mercedes-benz-cars\"><strong>Used Mercedes</strong></a> you are going to trip on your journeys better than owning the liability of a brand new car.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2>We have your favorite Used Mercedes, opening the doorway to options&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A used car comes with its perks. So, when you buy a Used Luxury car like Mercedes what is it that really matters and you look for in particular? Yes, what you are thinking is right that the primary benefit has to be the feeling of driving tension-free, without the jitters of getting that first dent or scratch, something only a brand new car is prone to but not anymore. Such experiences can also be felt with a Used Mercedes or with any of our pre-owned, second-hand luxury cars. You can even take it out for longer journeys as soon as you buy the used car, since taking a brand new car out for longer trips before the first service or inspection is something buyers avoid and you do not have to do that with us.

  "postcontent": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is never easy to write it all when we talk about a BMW. And now, it is also pretty powerful to talk about Used BMW and that you can own one and be proud of it. The BMW car models always left an impression of being raw and strong whenever on road, one of the many reasons why it is a thing for most car lovers. This is like a silent beast tamed and groomed over decades and whenever it is at the field of war and capabilities it aces more than it has been known for. Whenever BMW made its models with determination and power, it needed what it was making it for, to be the perfect luxury and rough-persona out there and be a car that fails no competition. A car that brings the race and not only wins one.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sporty beauty has been successfully winning buyers&rsquo; hearts both in the car market of India and abroad. Surprisingly, the value of a BMW doesn&rsquo;t get disturbed even if it is used, pre-owned, or second-hand. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The used car market in India has been the center of attention in the slow-growing automotive industry in India</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To own a new car or not to own it, that&rsquo;s the question that makes us choose between and make a life-changing decision. Buying a car is a big thing in a country like ours, and it is beautiful to witness how people attach themselves so much to cars. But, haven&rsquo;t we all often challenged our own beliefs about car ownership?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staggering questions inside our head made it tough to own a car of our own choice and desire, like Why own it? Or Wherever I go, there&rsquo;s hardly any parking space! Or I&rsquo;ll take a cab today, there&rsquo;s heavy traffic. And so on. These questions keep our minds engaged. This is especially true in the cities when cab-hailing services are available at our beck and call.</span></p>\r\n<h2>BMW styled like an icon for your best experiences</h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The price is one of the many reasons why the flourishing second-hand luxury car market is drawing all the attention because of a fine Used BMW that performs just like a new one: a smart investment for a car.

Hence, It&rsquo;s remarkably refined and isolating with a brilliant thing for passengers, and for drivers too, whether on a long long vacation or a wearisome commute shuttle.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><b><a href=\"/buy-used-bmw-cars-7-series\">Used BMW 7 Series</a>: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BMW 7 Series, in its latest avatar, is a modern-day amalgamation of sporty elegance and luxurious interiors.

There is no sportier way of achieving that feeling of perfect freedom.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><b><a href=\"/buy-used-bmw-cars-m-series\">Used BMW M-Series</a>: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the center of attention: the BMW-M cars impress from the very first moment with their exceptional presence. The self-assured character is primarily underlined by the distinctive front and on the side, the vertical Air Breather emphasizes the height of the vehicle.

  "postcontent": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speed and performance don&rsquo;t depend on size. The Porsche can be anything by design but a sports car by nature, which earned it well in the world of sporty luxury cars. But one thing also applies to every model: this Porsche is first and foremost a sports car. It is true when said that power is pointless if it isn't properly harnessed, and the Porsche intimate athleticism and staggering handling traits ensure it lives up to the German brand's illustrious history. And it did over the years. The car is loaded with the most desirable standard features and a full-on benefit performance you can ask for. It is boasted with an impressive appearance that will allow you to embark on your next journey away and beyond.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/buy-used-porsche-cars\"><b>Porsche</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was a realization of a dream its creators saw. The first sports car that was to bear the name Porsche was made by Ferdinand Anton Ernst - or Ferry Porsche. In his own words: &ldquo;In the beginning, I looked around and could not find the car I'd been dreaming of: a small, lightweight sports car that uses energy efficiently. So I decided to build it myself.&rdquo; You can live the dream today with us.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Porsche is the favorite of racers around the world and is of course an expensive car that not everyone can afford to buy.

Take the Boxster, which is a two-seater roadster, Boxster was the first Porsche's road vehicle to be originally designed as a roadster since the 550 Spyder. The first generation Boxster had a 2.5-liter flat six-cylinder engine but as the models got upgraded, the engines too were. Therefore, the performance kept on improving with every new upgrade. Guess what there is more!</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>Used Porsche is for your tranquil town and a fine ride</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every single model of Porsche is engineered to the highest level of precision so that the riders can enjoy an unmatched experience while riding in any of its models.

It was designed in the league of 550 Spyder due to its huge popularity among the speed aficionados.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong> <a href=\"/buy-used-porsche-cars-cayman\">Cayman </a></strong>: <b>&nbsp;</b>It is another sports car by Porsche that is inspired by its own sibling &ndash; the 2nd and 3rd generation of Boxster. Currently, it is one of the best beasts among its competitors. The Porsche Cayman (named after Caiman) was launched for the 2006 model year as a mid-engine 2-seat sports car. It utilizes adapted flat-6 engines that are between the Boxster and the 9111 in terms of output. One of the best luxury cars available on the market is the Cayman.</p>\r\n<p><strong> <a href=\"/buy-used-porsche-cars-911\">911 </a></strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purest driving experience you can buy from the Stuttgart stable.

At the end of the day, German precision and attention to detail with a feature-loaded cabin ensure that the Panamera is a testament to the level of quality one expects from Porsche.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong> <a href=\"/buy-used-porsche-cars-cayenne\">Cayenne </a></strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Porsche Cayenne has been an SUV vehicle built by Porsche since 2002. Cayenne is spacious and dynamic, regarded as a \"decathlete\" among sports cars. A 3.6-liter V6 petrol engine with a Tiptronic S 8-speed transmission is offered. In the Porsche Cayenne, two petrol engines are available. There are 2995 cc and 3996 cc diesel engines. It is available with an automatic transmission.</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>It is going to be a big deal for a Used Porsche with Big Boyz Toyz&nbsp;</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Porsche said that he looked around for his dream car, and when he couldn&rsquo;t find one he built one. He gave us a Porsche and we cannot be more grateful. That dream is curved and designed into every Porsche model as everyday comfort.

  "postcontent": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a blessing to own a luxury car that will push you through your limits and allow you to achieve the unexpected. Our minds wander when we think of owning a beautiful luxurious sporty car that outreaches every other model. And when our mind lands on a Porsche we wonder if the models that they gifted us are a royal hall or just a luxury car. It is slightly yet elegantly unique. For the individuals who view fun as a necessary part of their lives and who would prefer to sit in a sports seat than a cowhide easy chair. For the individuals who get their kicks by riding a rapid sports vehicle. Every Porsche model, used or not, Air Curtains in the front apron minimize the air turbulence created on the wheels and therefore minimize the drag by releasing the inflowing air precisely in front of the wheels from the wheel arches. The air admission grilles are outfitted with a honeycomb-style surface to complete their style.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Porsche has bought us car models that lie somewhere in between a <a href=\"/buy-used-bmw-cars-bmw-m5\"><strong>BMW M5</strong></a> and <a href=\"/buy-used-mercedes-benz-cars-s-class\"><strong>Mercedes S-class</strong></a> and yet so powerfully holds the capability to overpower both. And it has over the years of its reign. Porsche has remained at the top of the list because of its class apart models like Panamera and its popularity is evident from the fact that the brand rules the car market of luxury car enthusiasts within and beyond.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A further example of the performance-oriented design is the side air intakes behind the doors: the side blades, embossed with the &lsquo;GT4&rsquo; logo, create additional dynamic pressure. The result: a better supply of air and more efficient engine cooling. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us look back at the time and allow ourselves to know about the car brand we are getting into: it&rsquo;s an impressively fine Used Porsche we are talking about. So, if you are planning to own one, which you are, of course, we have a pre-owned and preloved Porsche for your convenient and favorable rides.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>Start your journey with vision, excitement, and passion with Porsche&nbsp;</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We should ask ourselves one question every morning: what did we do to deserve a Porsche in our life? The answer can be different but it is aligned by our strong determination and desire for the car. And why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? The car is enormous when it comes to questioning its design and beauty, a car that is a sporty saloon with the perfect curved body shape. Moreover, the long-wheelbase, shorter overhang at the front, and longer overhang at the rear already lend athletic dynamism and the evident sculpting of the side profile creates the customary Porsche waistline and sense of lightness like always.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchasing a vehicle isn't like purchasing some other article as owning a fine vehicle reflects what the individual relies upon; it figures out what an individual believes in. The inspiration driving why classy people reliably pick a vehicle that reflects the class of the owner. In any case, classy vehicles unnecessarily come at a strong expense, and as needs are, only a few have the money to buy them. What you buy is what you reflect.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><b>Bring on the new generation of driving: Buy Used Porsche at Big Boy Toyz&nbsp;</b></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BIG BOY TOYZ is India&rsquo;s No 1 Used Car Dealer that has remained strong in the desirable car market for over a decade now.

  "postcontent": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vintage and Classic car owners can now register their cars and drive them on public roads. As per an Amendment of the Motor Vehicles Act published in the Official Gazette, Vintage and Classic Cars that are more than 50 years of age shall be registered in respective states are per the rules of the Motor Vehicle Act. These cars will be given a special VA Series of number eg DL VA XXXX for Delhi state. Being registered and compliant under the MV Act shall allow users of these cars to ply their vintage and classic on public roads. The earlier ban by the Transport Ministry and various Courts meant that vintage and classic cars came under the rule that banned petrol cars of 15 years and older and diesel cars that were 10 years or older from plying on public roads.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/BUICK-SUPER-EIGHT.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was argued that vintage and classic cars are an important part of motoring history and are purchased to preserve their historic value. These cars are not used for commuting or transport. Owners sparing use these cars for rallies or exhibitions and for maintenance reasons to ensure that they remain in a functional state. The blanket ban on these cars made for an anomaly and made their ownership in cities cumbersome. The Ministry took note of this and passed an amendment to permit these cars to ply on roads subject to certain restrictions. The restrictions are that these cars shall not be used for commercial purposes and that these cars shall not be used for regular use. This means that for rallies and exhibitions, these cars are permitted to be driven.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Cadillace-V12.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please note that in order to comply with the MV Act, the new Registration Copy, valid Insurance, and Pollution Under Control Certificate should be present.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.bigboytoyz.com/new-version/article/Dodge-D-12.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Delhi state where the rules are enforced strictly, the State Transport Department has begun the process of registering cars under the new series.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now one can register their cars!
