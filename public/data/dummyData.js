          "Car Showrooms Provide Great Discounts And Deals, Why Don't You Guys Do So?",
        answer: `<p>We can't negotiate on the Car's price because we don't negotiate on the quality of our product. There is no point inflating the car's price and further putting it down. Negotiation will always remain a hindrance between buyer and seller to develop a trust or relationship for further business.
